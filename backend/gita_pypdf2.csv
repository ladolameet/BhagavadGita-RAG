War is nothing new to this world. Thousands of years 
ago wars were being fought, such as the one at Kurukßetra, 
to resolve the differences between good and evil and for 
the purpose of material gain. From ancient times to our 
modern era, practically not a day on this Earth has passed 
when someone, somewhere, was not fighting over some -
thing. Throughout history men have gathered on the field 
of battle to fulfil their greed for wealth and glory, some -
times nobly, but more often ignobly. The same is happen -
ing in the 21st Century. War it seems is an unavoidable 
karmic destiny of human civilisation.
Chapter 17
Peace, on the other hand, is rather elusive. Peace is 
talked about and even prayed for, but seldom makes more 
than a momentary appearance. Most of our lives, even for 
the humblest of souls, are spent struggling for existence 
either socially, politically, financially, mentally or physi -
cally. For most of us the temporary absence of any major 
crisis is what we would call peace. However, peace (or çånti 
as it is known amongst yogîs) is a state of consciousness 
and not a condition relative to the external affairs of the 
material world. Peace is an internal experience.
The wisdom of the Vedic literature, Çrîmad Bhågavatam  
says, jîvo-jîvasya-jîvanaµ  – one living being is food for 
another living being. From the minutest forms of life 
to the most complex, one life is sustained by the loss of 
another. Thus, the basic principle for material existence is 
fundamentally flawed with violence. Peace then, for most 
of us, comes in doing what we have to do and believing 
that we have done the right thing. Therein lies the fine line 
between war and peace. Is what we think to be good, or 
what we are conditioned to believe, actually right?
The ability to discriminate between right and wrong, or 
in some cases good and evil, largely depends on the extent 
of knowledge from which we draw our conclusions. A poor 
fund of knowledge naturally results in faulty conclusions. 
Therefore, it is in our best interest to seek out the greatest 
source of knowledge – knowledge of the Absolute Truth, 
and familiarise ourselves with that.
Bhagavad-gîtå  is perhaps the most widely read book 
of theistic knowledge in the world. Whatever knowledge 
one finds in similar books such as the Dhammapada, the 
Bible, the Torah, the Koran etc. is also found in the Bhaga -
Bhagavad-gita8
vad-gîtå.  But in the Bhagavad-gîtå  one will find knowl -
edge that is not present anywhere else. Consequently, the 
Bhagavad-gîtå  surpasses all branches of knowledge. What 
lies ahead in these commentaries is a look into the vastness 
of the knowledge of the Absolute Truth contained in the 
Bhagavad-gîtå ."

Anuv®tti
At the outset of the Kurukßetra war, Duryodhana 
made the classic military blunder of underestimating the 
strength of his adversary. Possibly blinded by his greed for 
the kingdom or by his longstanding hatred for his cousins, 
the På√∂avas, he entered the engagement thinking that his 
enemy’s strength was limited.
Hate and greed are certainly poor allies of judgment, 
usually resulting in wrong decisions and the senseless loss 
of life. No better examples in modern times need be cited 
than that of the wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan 
Chapter 111
wherein underestimating the will of a people has led to the 
loss of millions of innocent lives.
The classic commentators on Bhagavad-gîtå  have all 
pointed out the blunder of Duryodhana at Kurukßetra. 
Particularly it has been mentioned that Duryodhana failed 
to recognise that when Çrî K®ß√a, the Supreme Person, 
was there to advise Arjuna, that Arjuna would be a most 
formidable opponent.
History has shown us that wars are fought out of greed, 
hatred or religious prejudice. It is simply a convenience to 
think that, ‘God is on our side.’ The idea that ‘God is on 
our side’ is certainly a comforting thought and has accom -
panied men into almost every war that we know of since 
the rise of Abrahamic religions. However, the problem has 
always been that in all these conflicts both sides assumed 
the banner of righteousness, declaring, ‘God wills it!’ This 
is sometimes called the ‘theology of convenience’.
Even today it makes good to stir up the troops or rally 
the suicide bombers to their deaths by declaring that, 
“God favours our cause.” It is a fact that during these 
dark periods of history, more people have died, and more 
innocent people put to death in the name of God, than 
by any other single unnatural cause. Many people con -
sider despotic political regimes as the ultimate empires 
of cruelty, but the truth is that religious fanaticism has 
brought far more unnecessary death to the world than any 
political system of government.
So what makes the war at Kurukßetra any different 
than modern wars fought for greed or between religious 
fanatics? Is it not simply jingoism to say that because Çrî 
K®ß√a, the Supreme Person, was on the side of the På√∂a -
Bhagavad-gita12
vas that they were correct in destroying their enemies? 
The difference is that Kurukßetra was not fought because 
one side had a different religious ideology than the other. 
Kurukßetra was a fratricidal war – a family feud brought 
on by human faults: greed for sovereignty, failure in duty, 
envy, family attachment and falsely identifying the body 
as the self.
But unlike any other war in history, Kurukßetra would 
record a profound lesson for the benefit of all future gen -
erations. The lesson was taught by Çrî K®ß√a in the form 
of Bhagavad-gîtå  – a lesson that would enable humanity to 
overcome its mundane shortcomings, become established 
in transcendence and attain self-realisation."

Anuv®tti
Çrî K®ß√a is known as Pårtha-sårathi, the chariot-driver 
of Arjuna. Because K®ß√a was Arjuna’s friend and compan -
ion, he requested K®ß√a to draw his chariot between the 
two armies so that he could see with whom he was to do 
battle. But upon seeing the enemy before him, Arjuna was 
shocked and fell into a state of bewilderment.
Now the stage at Kurukßetra was set, so that Çrî K®ß√a 
could speak Bhagavad-gîtå  – Arjuna became overwhelmed 
with grief and gave up his duty. As a warrior Arjuna was 
duty-bound to fight, but seeing the ordeal that lay ahead 
he could not proceed.
The world is certainly full of faults, dangers, unfortu -
nate events, cruel and hateful designs to exploit others and 
a host of other qualities that one would certainly describe 
as evil. To quote Edmund Burke, the Irish statesman and 
Bhagavad-gita16
philosopher, “The only thing necessary for evil to triumph 
is for good men to stand by and do nothing.”
Arjuna had resolved in his mind not to fight, knowing 
that the destruction of the dynasty meant the loss of tradi -
tion, the onslaught of degradation, the birth of unwanted 
children etc. and thus evil would be the only outcome. 
Arjuna also understood deep within himself that to do 
nothing also assured grim repercussions."

Bhagavad-gita22
Anuv®tti
Figuratively speaking we would say that Arjuna was 
‘caught between a hard spot and a rock’. Therefore, Arjuna 
intelligently approached Çrî K®ß√a and appealed for His 
intervention. Knowing that Çrî K®ß√a was the Absolute 
Truth, complete with all opulence and knowledge, Arjuna 
approached Çrî K®ß√a, addressing Him as H®ßîkeça (Master 
of the senses), as Acyuta (the infallible), as Keçava (the 
killer of the Keçî demon), as Govinda (one who pleases 
the senses), as Madhusüdana (the killer of the Madhu 
demon), as Janårdana (the Maintainer of all living beings), 
as Mådhava (the husband of the goddess of fortune) and as 
Vårß√eya (the descendant of the V®ß√i Dynasty).
Arjuna addressed Çrî K®ß√a by His different names 
in order to invoke K®ß√a’s mercy and compassion for 
the predicament that Arjuna was in. As H®ßîkeça, K®ß√a 
is the Master of the mind and senses  – thus He is never 
bewildered or put into illusion. As Acyuta, He is incapa -
ble of making mistakes or wrong decisions. Arjuna needed 
K®ß√a’s advice urgently – advice that he could depend on, 
that would give relief to his disturbed mind and senses.
As Keçava, K®ß√a is the killer of the demon Keçî who 
represents the false sense of greatness. Çrî K®ß√a is known 
to have killed numerous demons during His advent and 
each of those demons represented negative qualities that 
hinder one’s progress in spiritual life such as the desire for 
name and fame, dishonesty, false pride, deceitfulness, cru -
elty, foolishness, violence, lust, anger, greed, false teachings 
and bad habits etc. Arjuna was confident that by taking 
shelter of Çrî K®ß√a, all that was an impediment to his sit -
uation would be removed.
Chapter 123
By addressing K®ß√a as the descendant of the V®ß√i 
Dynasty, Arjuna was also reminding K®ß√a of the impor -
tance of family traditions and to destroy them was Arjuna’s 
biggest dilemma.

Bhagavad-gitaAnuv®tti
This second chapter is where the Bhagavad-gîtå  truly 
begins.  Bhagavad-gîtå  literally means the ‘Song of Bhaga -
vån’ and Bhagavån  means the Absolute Truth. Here for 
the first time in Bhagavad-gîtå,  Çrî K®ß√a is addressed as 
Bhagavån. According to Vedic scholars such as Paråçara 
Muni, Bhagavån  means one who possesses all wealth, 
strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. 
aiçvaryasya samagrasya vîryasya yaçasa˙ çriya˙
jñåna vairågyayos caiva ßa√√åµ bhaga itî ra√å
He that possesses the attributes of sovereignty, 
potency, fame, wealth, knowledge and renunciation 
in full, is known as Bhagavån. ( Viß√u Purå√a  6.5.74)
Additionally, Jîva Gosvåmî, the 16th Century Vaiß√ava 
philosopher, says that Bhagavån is bhajanîya gu√a ca 
ananta ca nitya˙ –  He that possesses all adorable qualities 
and whose all-attractive nature is such that He attracts our 
feelings of affection and adoration.
In contemporary society there is much debate as to 
whether God exists or not. First it is necessary to define 
what we mean by ‘God’ before His existence can be deter -
mined or dismissed. Accordingly, seers of the truth in 
ancient India have concluded that if there is a God, then 
God must necessarily be the owner and proprietor of 
everything; He must be all-powerful, the most famous, the 
most beautiful, the possessor of all knowledge and at the 
same time, detached or renounced. After careful analysis, 
those seers of truth concluded that only Çrî K®ß√a could 
be and is the ultimate fountainhead of Reality, the Abso -
Chapter 231
lute Truth. These findings have been corroborated by many 
sages throughout the ages (from before 10,000 BCE) and 
are dealt with extensively in the Vedic literatures such as 
the Vedas , Upanißads, Purå√as, Råmåya√a, Mahåbhårata, 
Vedånta-sütra, Çrîmad Bhågavatam and Brahma-saµhitå  etc.
îçvara˙ parama˙ k®ß√a˙ sac-cid-ånanda vigraha˙
anådir ådir govinda˙ sarva-kåra√a-kåra√aµ
K®ß√a is the Supreme Controller. His form is made 
of bliss, knowledge and eternity. He is the origin of 
all. He is the Master of the cows and the senses. He 
has no other origin and He is the primeval cause of 
all causes. ( Brahma-saµhitå  5.1)
ete cåµça kalå˙ puµsa˙ k®ß√as tu bhagavån svayam
indråri vyåkulaµ lokaµ m®∂ayanti yuge yuge
The various avatåras  are either plenary expansions 
or parts of plenary expansions. But K®ß√a is the orig -
inal source of all avatåras . When impious elements 
disturb His devotees, He manifests age after age in 
order to protect them. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam  1.3.28)
harir eva sadårådhya˙ sarva-deveçvareçvara˙
itare brahma-rudrådyå nava-jñeyå˙ kadåcana
Only Çrî Hari (K®ß√a) should be worshipped as the 
Master of the entire universe. Brahmå, Çiva and all 
other demigods never violate this principle at any 
time. ( Padma Purå√a )
Bhagavad-gitayatråvatîr√aµ k®ß√åkhyaµ
paraµ brahmå naråk®tim
When the Supreme Person descends in His human-
like form, He is K®ß√a, the Supreme Brahman. 
(Viß√u Purå√a  4.11.2)
tasmåt k®ß√a eva paro devas taµ dhyåyet
taµ raset taµ bhajet taµ yajet
Thus K®ß√a is the Supreme Person. One should 
meditate on Him. One should delight in Him. One 
should worship Him and make offerings to Him. 
(Gopåla-tåpanî Upanißad  1.54)
k®ßir bhü-våcaka˙ çabdo √aç ca nirv®ti-våcaka˙
tayor aikyaµ paraµ brahma k®ß√a ityabhidhîyate
The verbal root k®ß refers to the all-attractive quality 
of K®ß√a, and the syllable √a refers to His spiritual 
bliss. When k®ß is added to the affix √a, it becomes 
the word K®ß√a,  indicating the Supreme Truth. 
(Mahåbhårata, Udyoga-parva  71.4)
Arjuna has become overwhelmed with compassion for 
those who are about to die on the battlefield. In fact, such 
is his grief that he himself is prepared to die rather than 
kill his enemies. But Arjuna is a warrior and from a noble 
family, therefore K®ß√a advises Arjuna against his weakness 
of heart. If one is a warrior it is one’s duty to face the enemy 
and not cower away. Fighting is indeed a nasty business, 
but when duty calls, such fighting may be unavoidable. In 
ancient times, acts of aggression were abhorred and strictly 
Chapter 233
forbidden in society and between nations. When such 
aggression did occur, retaliation and war were acceptable. 
According to the great sage Vasiß†ha, there are six types of 
aggressors and according to Manu-saµhitå  these aggressors 
are to be met with lethal response.
agnido garadaç caiva çastra-på√ir dhanåpaha˙
kßetra-dåråpahårî ca ßa∂ ete hyåtatåyina˙
The arsonist who sets fire to one’s house, one who 
administers poison, one who attacks with deadly 
weapons, one who usurps a nations resources, one 
who invades and occupies a sovereign country and 
one who kidnaps one’s family members - all should 
be considered as aggressors. ( Vasiß†ha-sm®ti  3.19)
åtatåyinam åyåntaµ hanyåd evåvicårayan
nåtatåyi-vadhe doßo hantur bhavati kaçcana
Without hesitation a warrior should destroy aggres -
sors, as there is no bad reaction in slaying them. 
(Manu-saµhitå  8.350)
These verses are according to the rules given in the laws 
of society  (artha-çåstra ). Yet the laws of dharma  (dhar-
ma-çåstra ), which are superior to the artha-çåstra,  state 
that one should never inflict harm on any living being ( må 
hiµsyåt sarva-bhütåni ) – what to say of one’s family mem -
bers and superiors?
This was Arjuna’s dilemma. Being a softhearted devo -
tee of Çrî K®ß√a, Arjuna was disinclined to take up arms 
against his family members, but being a warrior he had 
to face his destiny. In this state of bewilderment, Arjuna 
Bhagavad-gitadecided to put aside his casual relationship with K®ß√a as a 
friend and accept Çrî K®ß√a as his guru (spiritual master). 
Thus K®ß√a accepted Arjuna as a disciple.
According to Vedic knowledge there are numerous 
planets and parallel universes wherein life can be found. 
Some of these planets and universes have higher standards 
of living than we experience on Earth and some are lower. 
If one performs one’s prescribed duties in this life then 
accordingly, one is elevated to higher planets. However, if 
one neglects his duty then only infamy and descending to 
lower planets awaits one in the next life.
K®ß√a has used the word anårya  meaning ‘non- åryan ’ 
to describe Arjuna’s disinclination to follow his prescribed 
Vedic duties. For centuries there has been much contro -
versy about who is an åryan  and where the åryans  came 
from. For the most part, all such considerations have been 
based upon bodily designations in order to establish one 
race of people as superior to another. But in Bhagavad-gîtå,  
according to the words of Çrî K®ß√a, the åryans  are those 
who carry out their duties in accordance with the Vedic 
injunctions. Thus it is understood that the word åryan  
does not pertain to a particular race of people, but to a 
conception of life and a way of living.
Knowledge of the eternal existence of the infinite con -
sciousness (K®ß√a) and the finite individual unit of con -
sciousness ( åtmå  or the self) is the key to all Vedic wisdom. 
This will be the central theme of K®ß√a’s instruction to 
Arjuna in this chapter.

Arjuna is lamenting for the loss of the body, but Çrî 
K®ß√a does not approve of his lamentation and reminds 
Arjuna that all living beings are eternal. K®ß√a says that 
He, Arjuna and all those present on the field of battle are 
eternal personalities – they have existed eternally in the 
past and they will exist eternally in the future.
Arjuna is an accomplished student of Vedic thought and 
an associate of Çrî K®ß√a, but for the benefit of those who 
will study this erudite conversation in the future, Arjuna 
is feigning bewilderment and confusion just to encourage 
the discourse. Arjuna is considered a liberated personality 
and thus he is actually above ignorance and bewilderment.
Although consciousness is eternal, the material body 
does not share this quality. The body passes through the 
stages of birth, childhood, youth, old age, disease and 
Bhagavad-gitadeath. At death, consciousness transfers to another body 
according to the laws of material nature ( karma ) and begins 
the cycle yet again. The ever-changing body never bewil -
ders those who are cognisant of the difference between the 
material body and consciousness.
Embodied consciousness is said to have five stages 
known as the pañca-koça  – annamaya  (satisfying our exist -
ence by eating, as seen in children), prå√amaya  (conscious -
ness of the preservation of one’s body), manomaya  (the 
stage of mental awareness), vijñånamaya  (the cultivation of 
consciousness based on higher knowledge, understanding 
one is not this material body) and ånandamaya  (cultivating 
and entering into one’s relationship with the Supreme as 
part and parcel of K®ß√a). The first three stages, annamaya , 
prå√amaya  and manomaya  pertain to all living beings that 
are caught in the doldrums of material sense enjoyment. 
Vijñånamaya  and ånandamaya  concerns those who have 
acquired knowledge of self-realisation ( vijñåna ) and per -
fection ( ånanda ).
Those who are asleep, simply absorbed in bodily iden -
tification, never experience the world beyond their sense 
perception. Heat and cold, happiness and distress, pleasure 
and pain, birth and death – these are the perceptions of life 
experienced by those with no knowledge of consciousness. 
But those who are liberated from the bodily concept of life 
are awake in the conscious world and are always in balance, 
even in the face of opposing and contradictory situations 
in the material world. They are undisturbed."

Herein, Çrî K®ß√a is reiterating the superiority of con -
sciousness over matter. Since the time of Darwin, and 
even amongst some philosophers of ancient India such as 
Bhagavad-gitaCårvåka up to the present day, there are those who think 
that life arises out of matter. The Big Bang Theory and 
other contemporary scientific ideas also support this 
opinion. However, the problem with such thinking is that 
there is no concrete evidence whatsoever to explain or 
demonstrate how lifeless matter ever developed the symp -
toms of life. The Theory of Evolution, as the Darwinians 
understand it, is substantially defeated in the fossil record, 
since no ‘transitional species,’ that are supposed to reveal 
the gradual evolution of living organisms from primitive 
species to advanced life forms, have ever been discovered. 
Furthermore, there is no suitable model to explain where 
matter originated.
The numerous theories, new and ancient, that expound 
that life arose from matter are fundamentally flawed in 
many ways. On the other hand, from observing micro -
scopic living creatures to giant creatures like the elephant 
and whale, it is self-evident that life comes from life. Thus, 
the Vedic perspective on life is that all life comes from an 
intelligent life source, Çrî K®ß√a.
Scientific interest in finding the cause of the universe, 
and indeed to all life, is certainly laudable. Yet when all 
reasonable and honest research leads us to the conclusion 
that life/consciousness is not a byproduct of matter and 
the blueprint of intelligent design can be observed every -
where and in all things, then it should also be intelligently 
concluded that Super Consciousness is the cause of matter, 
the universe and all living things."

Bhagavad-gitaAnuv®tti
It is sometimes thought that God, or some source of 
higher intelligence, has created life in the universe, but 
herein Çrî K®ß√a expresses that the individual conscious -
ness of a living being is never actually created. It exists eter -
nally as part and parcel of K®ß√a, as part and parcel of  the 
Super Consciousness. In the Vedic concept of the Abso -
lute Truth, K®ß√a exists eternally along with His energies. 
Consciousness by that measure is never created; it simply 
exists eternally as part and parcel of the Absolute Truth.
The characteristics of consciousness are described as 
unborn, eternal, indestructible and timeless – that which is 
not destroyed when the body is destroyed. The effects of 
time on the material body are perceived as growth, main -
tenance, by-products, old age, dwindling and death. But 
consciousness, being transcendental to matter, transcends 
time and therefore never grows old, dwindles or dies.
In certain religious traditions the Creator is sometimes 
visualised as being an old man in the sky. He is naturally 
thought of as old because He has fathered the universe a 
long time ago and He is the oldest of all. But here again 
the conception of Bhagavad-gîtå  differs dramatically. Con -
sciousness is ever fresh and the source of consciousness, the 
Super Conscious Being, is always youthful and never old.
Those who are engrossed in material affairs and who 
ignore the wisdom of Bhagavad-gîtå  will find it very diffi -
cult to overcome the bodily concept of life and understand 
the difference between matter and consciousness.

The transcendental nature of consciousness has been 
described in the above verses. It cannot be cut, burned or 
even touched by water or air. However, the material body 
is subject to all the above. Consciousness is described as 
eternal because it can never be destroyed. It is omnipresent 
because it animates and gives feeling to all parts of the 
body. It is unchanging because it never becomes anything 
other than what it is – pure consciousness. It is immovable 
because it does not change its constitutional position. It is 
primeval because it is the oldest of all. It is imperceptible 
because it lies beyond the range of the physical senses. It is 
inconceivable because it is beyond the speculative function 
of the mind, and it is immutable because it is part and 
parcel of the Absolute Truth."

The individual unit of consciousness is difficult to 
understand because it is transcendental, a non-material sub -
stance, and cannot be seen with the material senses or even 
with the world’s most powerful microscope. It is atomic 
in size and can only be perceived through perfect intelli -
gence. This atomic unit of consciousness is situated in the 
midst of the five kinds of subtle life-airs within the body 
(prå√a, apåna, vyåna, samåna, udåna ). It is located within 
the heart and spreads its influence throughout the body. 
To give us some idea of the minuteness of the åtmå and its 
positioning within the body, the Çvetåçvatara Upanißad  and 
Mu√∂aka Upanißad  provide the following information:
bålågra-çata bhågasya çatadhå kalpitasya ca
bhågo jîva˙ sa vijñeya˙ sa cånantyåya kalpate
When the upper part of a hair is divided into one 
hundred parts and again each of those parts is fur -
ther divided into one hundred parts, each part is the 
dimension of the åtmå. (Çvetåçvatara Upanißad 5.9)
Chapter 247
eßo’√ur åtmå cetaså veditavyo
yasmin prå√a˙ pañcadhå saµviveça
prå√aiç cittaµ sarvam otam prajånåµ
yasmin viçuddhe vibhavaty-eßa åtmå
The åtmå is atomic in size and can be perceived 
by perfect intelligence. This atomic åtmå is floating 
in the five kinds of airs, is situated in the heart, 
and spreads its influence all over the body of the 
embodied living beings. When the åtmå is purified 
from its contamination of the five kinds of material 
airs, its spiritual influence is exhibited. ( Mu√∂aka 
Upanißad  3.1.9)
The cycle of birth and death ( saµsåra ) is described as 
a natural phenomenon for one who is embodied. Although 
such a conception may be considered a fatalistic world 
view, both birth and death are an unwanted experience for 
the embodied consciousness. After experiencing life, no 
sane person wants to die – everyone has the desire to live 
as long as possible.
To that end, nowadays the producers of wonder drugs 
promise us eternal life, although no such life-giving cures 
exist at present – everyone has to die and before death 
comes, the wonder drugs and doctors fees are sure to bank -
rupt the family fortune. However, death is an unnatural 
experience. The fact that everyone seeks everlasting life 
should be indicative that such a pure state of life exists 
beyond birth and death. Indeed it does and Çrî K®ß√a will 
shed light on that subject as this chapter develops.

Arjuna’s social position was that of a kßatriya , a 
member of the warrior class. As such, it was Arjuna’s 
solemn duty to uphold righteousness and to protect the 
kingdom from aggressors. By law and social decree, Arjuna 
and his brothers were the rightful heirs to the throne, yet 
the throne had been usurped by his uncle Dh®taråß†ra. 
Arjuna, his wife Draupadî, his mother Kuntî and his 
brothers Yudhiß†hira, Bhîma, Sahadeva and Nakula had 
all been forcibly exiled from the kingdom.
Çrî K®ß√a knows the temperament of Arjuna very well 
and therefore He is appealing to Arjuna’s kßatriya  spirit 
to stand and fight. K®ß√a reminds Arjuna that only shame 
awaits him if he neglects his duty. His enemies will speak 
Chapter 251
ill of him and claim that he is a coward. Such neglect of his 
duty will lead to infamy, not to glory.
A kßatriya,  when called to battle, should never aban -
don his duty under any circumstance. K®ß√a tells Arjuna 
that if he is killed in battle while defending the king -
dom, such an act of heroism will promote him to a higher 
status in his next life. Or, K®ß√a says, if he is victorious in 
battle then he will regain the kingdom and enjoy life on 
Earth. In any case, K®ß√a strongly encourages Arjuna not

The greatest fear that is mentioned in the above verse 
is the fear of losing the human form of life and taking 
birth in an animal body or lower. Some people think of 
the consciousness that is generally called åtmå as being 
human and other åtmås  as being animal etc. But in reality 
no such distinction between a human åtmå and an animal 
åtmå exists. One transmigrates, according to one’s karma , 
through many lower species of life and eventually arrives 
at the human stage. 
Human life offers one the opportunity of self-reali -
sation or the chance to cultivate spiritual knowledge and 
awareness. One who attempts to become self-realised is 
not always successful in one attempt or in one lifetime. 
However, Çrî K®ß√a gives us the assurance that even a 
little endeavour on the path of self-realisation will save 
us from the greatest fear, namely that of taking birth in a 
lower life form.
The perfection of self-realisation in the yoga system 
is called samådhi , or the complete absorption of our con -
sciousness in the Supreme. The student of bhakti-yoga  
achieves such a state of self-realisation by following the 
Bhagavad-gitainstructions of Çrî K®ß√a with steady determination. This 
state is only possible due to the great boon of having 
attained a human form of life.
However, if one neglects the opportunity of self-real -
isation in human life then one certainly runs the risk of 
sinking down into animal life or worse. It is sometimes 
argued that animals like cats and dogs have a better, more 
comfortable life than many humans, and that is certainly 
true for many cats and dogs in western countries. But there 
is no guarantee that in losing the human form of life one 
will become a dog or cat and be taken care of by a rich 
American family. One may become an animal that is eaten 
alive by wild beasts or torn apart by predators in the sea. 
Certainly it goes without saying that such a life and death 
is full of suffering.
Therefore, to avoid the unnecessary suffering found in 
animal life, a person who has achieved the human platform 
should, with great determination and diligence, pursue the 
path of self-realisation as outlined in Bhagavad-gîtå."

To be situated in transcendence means to be liberated 
from the three modes of material nature – the modes of 
ignorance, passion and goodness ( tama-gu√a, raja-gu√a  
and sattva-gu√a ). Yoga is the practice of becoming situ -
ated beyond the modes of nature. Everyone in the material 
world is under the three modes of nature and only a true 
yogî can surpass these modes.
Our activities are categorised in three ways – as action 
prescribed by the Vedas  (karma ), unauthorised action 
(vikarma ) and transcendental action ( akarma ). Karma  
means those activities that derive a good result and some -
Bhagavad-gitatimes promote one to higher planets or higher standards 
of living. Vikarma  are those activities that are against the 
Vedic injunctions and cause suffering to the self and to 
other living creatures. Akarma  means those activities that 
have neither good nor bad reactions.
One who is wise and who knows the science of yoga 
always strives to perform the activities of akarma . Such 
yogîs are known as bhakti-yogîs  and can easily situate them -
selves in transcendence. Other systems of yoga such as 
aß†å∫ga-yoga, råja-yoga, ku√∂alinî-yoga, ha†ha-yoga  and 
kriyå-yoga  can also reach transcendence, but the path is 
very difficult, especially in this modern age.
Çrî K®ß√a is known as Yogeçvara, the Supreme Master 
of yoga,  and although Bhagavad-gîtå discusses other yoga 
systems, it is the bhakti-yoga  system that K®ß√a ultimately 
recommends. The yogî situated in bhakti-yoga  is always 
engaged in devotional activities to satisfy the Supreme 
Master of yoga, Çrî K®ß√a. Thus, the bhakti-yogî  is always 
in complete control of his senses. Without control of the 
senses no one can perform meditation or engage in spiritual 
practices properly. Therefore, the bhakti-yogî  is the top -
most yogî because he is engaged in the topmost yoga system.
There are eight mystical perfections of yoga known as the 
aß†a-siddhis . These perfections are – becoming very small 
(a√imå-siddhi ), becoming lighter than air ( laghimå-siddhi ), 
being able to retrieve anything from anywhere, such as 
extending one’s hand while in New York and picking a 
mango growing in India  (pråpti-siddhi ), to become heav -
ier than the heaviest (mahimå-siddhi ), to create something 
wonderful or to destroy anything at will  (îçitva-siddhi ),  to 
control the material elements ( vaçitva-siddhi ), the ability to 
Chapter 259
fulfil all of one’s desires  (pråkåmya-siddhi ) and  the ability 
to assume any form one wishes ( kåmåvasåyitå-siddhi ). As 
the Master of yoga, K®ß√a has these eight yoga perfections 
in full.
It is sometimes claimed by yogîs that they have achieved 
one or more of these aß†a-siddhis  and such seems to have 
been relatively common in ancient times. But in modern 
times the claim of having one of the aß†a-siddhis,  more often 
than not, turns out to be fraudulent or simply a show to 
attract many followers. With the rise in popularity of yoga, 
false claims of aß†a-siddhis  have become a lucrative business.
A higher aspiration for the yogî is not the achievement 
of the aß†a-siddhis,  but the achievement of samådhi  in bhak-
ti-yoga  because such achievement frees one from the cycle 
of birth and death."

Anuv®tti
As previously stated, there are numerous yoga systems. 
Çrî K®ß√a states unequivocally that by the system of with -
drawing one’s senses from the objects of the senses, namely 
sound, touch, taste, smell and sight for sense satisfaction 
and concentrating the mind on Him, one becomes firmly 
situated in divine knowledge and samådhi .
Simply suspending the senses without positive engage -
ment for advancing in spiritual life is not very profitable. 
Many yogîs have tried giving up sense activities altogether, 
but because the taste, or attachment, for sense-objects 
remains, many have fallen down in their attempts. How -
ever, the senses of the bhakti -yogî who follows K®ß√a’s 
direction are safeguarded because the senses are engaged 
twenty-fours hours a day in K®ß√a’s service. As such, the 
taste for sensual satisfaction gradually dries up and disap -
pears leaving the bhakti -yogî free to advance spiritually.
One who cannot control the senses cannot concentrate 
the mind. Additionally, the senses are never actually satis -
fied by material engagement. The senses become satiated 
for sometime, but then again become stimulated with an 
even greater avarice. Those who are servants of the bodily 
senses can never become masters of the self. 
Being fully absorbed in pure spiritual consciousness or 
samådhi  means to be conscious of K®ß√a as the Supreme 
Chapter 263
Person. Such absorption of the mind and senses in K®ß√a 
is called K®ß√a consciousness."

O Pårtha, having attained realisation of the Absolute Truth 
one is never bewildered. If one is situated in this state at 
the time of death, one attains brahma-nirvå√am , the abode 
of pure consciousness, and all suffering ceases.  
Anuv®tti
The highest achievement by accepting the instructions 
of Çrî K®ß√a in Bhagavad-gîtå is given here. One who 
does so at the time of death, attains brahma-nirvå√am , 
the spiritual planets of Vaiku√†ha and the mitigation of 
all suffering.
According to the knowledge of self-realised souls, the 
Absolute Truth has three stages of realisation – Brahman, 
Paramåtmå and Bhagavån. 
vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaµ yaj jñånam advayam
brahmeti paramåtmeti bhagavån iti çabdyate
The seers that know the Absolute Truth call this 
non-dual substance Brahman, Paramåtmå or Bhaga -
vån. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam  1.2.11)
Brahman means attaining the impersonal light experi -
ence or effulgence of the Absolute. The word ‘Brahman’ 
is found throughout the Vedic literature and according to 
scholars of bhakti-yoga , ultimately means Viß√u or K®ß√a.
The Buddhist philosophers take nirvå√a  to be the end 
of material life and entering into the void, but Bhaga -
vad-gîtå  teaches differently. In the Vedic teachings there is 
Bhagavad-gitano void anywhere. Everything is the energy of the Absolute 
Truth and no existence or non-existence is reconcilable 
outside of that.
According to the prominent sages of bhakti-yoga , 
Viçvanåtha Cakravartî translates brahma-nirvå√am  as lib -
eration. His disciple, Baladeva Vidyåbhüßa√a understands 
brahma-nirvå√am  as Paramåtmå who is Viß√u, the form 
of liberation. Råmånuja takes Brahman as the åtmå and 
nirvå√am  as full of happiness. Madhva takes brahma-nir -
vå√am  as Viß√u/K®ß√a without a material form. Bhakti 
Rakßaka Çrîdhara Mahåråja takes brahma-nirvå√am  as 
freedom from material bondage and A.C. Bhaktivedånta 
Svåmî Prabhupåda takes brahma-nirvå√am  as meaning 
the kingdom of Viß√u/K®ß√a. In all cases, the devotees 
of K®ß√a never accept liberation in the impersonal state of 
Brahman or the void because they are only interested in 
service to K®ß√a and are already liberated.
Paramåtmå means realisation of the Absolute situated 
in the hearts of all living things – the Maintainer of the 
universe, being situated within and in between every parti -
cle of matter. 
Bhagavån is the realisation of the personal aspect of 
the Absolute Truth and is considered to be the ultimate 
stage of self-realisation, because in that stage one realises 
the Absolute Truth in toto as K®ß√a, the fountainhead of 
all energies. The abode of K®ß√a is known as Vaiku√†ha or 
Goloka V®ndåvana.
Furthermore, verse 71 refers to the aha∫kåra,  or the 
false ego, that is attached to consciousness when driven 
by the modes of material nature. False ego presupposes 
the existence of real ego – that real ego being the pure 
Chapter 269
consciousness of a living being. Thinking oneself to be the 
material body, or thinking oneself to be the enjoyer of the 
senses, is the cause and the effect of false ego. Such false 
ego never leads to enlightenment, but to repeated births 
and deaths in the cycle of saµsåra . The false ego is like a 
shadow of darkness that covers pure consciousness. The 
pure ego is non-different from pure consciousness itself. 
Pure ego is to realise oneself as part and parcel of the 
Absolute Truth and eternal servant of K®ß√a.

One cannot abstain from activities even for a moment. 
Indeed, all living beings are forced to engage in activities 
due to the influence of the modes of material nature. 
Anuv®tti
The purpose of Bhagavad-gîtå  is to elevate one beyond 
the bodily concept of life to the plane of consciousness or 
understanding the nature of the self. Çrî K®ß√a has already 
established this in the Second Chapter, but it appears that 
Arjuna finds some contradiction in what K®ß√a has said. 
Arjuna asks K®ß√a to further explain wisdom and action 
Chapter 375
so that he may follow the proper path. This confusion is 
common amongst novices – should one be a philosopher 
who is indifferent to the affairs of the material world, or 
should one engage in one’s prescribed duties?
What is ultimately to be understood by K®ß√a’s instruc -
tions is that both wisdom and proper engagement are 
interdependent. One is not complete without the other. 
Engagement, sometimes seen as spiritual practices, without 
philosophy is merely sentiment and philosophy without 
practice is mental speculation. Religious practices without 
a solid philosophical basis often lead to fanaticism that 
results in destruction and death. Our modern world is all 
too aware of this.
The interdependent relationship between philosophy 
and spiritual practice is indispensable for one who wants 
to achieve the perfection of human life. Actions should 
be performed with proper knowledge, only then does one 
achieve the proper result and is considered a true yogî."

Other than that, all other activities bind one to this mate -

from any attachment.
Anuv®tti
The Vedic injunctions enjoin that all activities should 
be performed as an offering to Viß√u/K®ß√a – yajño vai 
viß√u˙ . No embodied being can give up action even for a 
Chapter 377
moment because in the material world everyone is forced 
to act under the influence of the modes of nature. It is also 
said that the pure nature of the åtmå is to be engaged in 
the spiritual activities of serving the Supreme Being, K®ß√a. 
Therefore, all activities are to be connected to, and for the 
satisfaction of Viß√u/K®ß√a. This is known as the consti -
tutional position of the åtmå.
It is clear from the above verses that action is better 
than inaction. As it is said, “An idle mind is the Devil’s 
workshop.” If the senses are idle and one tries to empty 
the mind, then what usually transpires is that the mind 
becomes engaged in unproductive thoughts and eventually 
the sense-objects carry the mind and senses away.
The influence of the modes of material nature over the 
åtmå is called måyå , or illusion. This måyå  is the external 
energy of the Absolute Truth. When the åtmå is separated, 
or disconnected from the Absolute Truth by improper 
philosophical understanding or improper activities, the 
result is bewilderment, confusion and saµsåra ."

In verse 10 Brahmå is mentioned as the creator. 
According to the Vedas , Brahmå is the first living being in 
this universe and is manifest directly by Viß√u. Brahmå’s 
function is as the secondary creator of the planetary sys -
tems. In modern times, some atheistic thinkers, such as 
Professor Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist 
from Oxford University, have conceded that aliens from 
another planet may have possibly seeded life on Earth. 
Far-fetched as this may sound to some of us, the idea does 
come very close to the truth.
The ancient texts of India state that Brahmå resides 
in the highest realm in the universe known as Satya-loka. 
Some of the offspring of Brahmå known as the Prajåpatis 
are then sent forth to seed life throughout the cosmos. 
But rather than look at Brahmå as an alien, the Vedic 
texts describe him as the father of all living beings in the 
material world.
Since western civilisation first came into contact with 
the pantheon of Vedic demigods there has always been 
the speculation that the Vedic people, often referred to 
Bhagavad-gitaas Hindus, were pagans – pagan meaning the worshippers 
of many gods and not one Supreme God. Thus western 
observers conclude that monotheism, the worship or rever -
ence of one Supreme God, originated with the Abrahamic 
religions of the west. This however is not a fact.
The Vedic pantheon does indeed include many lesser 
demigods, but the Vedic texts are quite clear that there 
is only one Supreme Being or Super Consciousness that 
is above all. That is always referred to as Brahman, Par -
amåtmå, Bhagavån, Viß√u or K®ß√a. For example, the ‰g 
Veda (1. 22. 20) states as follows:
tad viß√o˙ paramaµ padaµ sadå paçyanti suraya˙
divîva cakßur åtatam
The divine feet of Viß√u are above all, like the sun 
above our heads. His holy feet are like the vigilant 
eye of a grand guardian over our heads like the sun.
Çrîmad Bhågavatam  says:
ete cåmça kalå˙ pumsa˙ k®ß√as tu bhagavån svayam
The various avatåras  are either plenary expansions 
or parts of plenary expansions. But Çrî K®ß√a is 
the original source of all these avatåras . (Çrîmad 
Bhågavatam  1.3.28)
Historically speaking, it is erroneous to assume that 
monotheism was developed by Abrahamic civilisations 
independent of any outside influence. In fact, the Abra -
hamic religions borrowed the idea of monotheism from the 
Persians after King Cyrus subjugated Babylon and Judea 
Chapter 381
circa 500 BCE. Prior to the arrival of the Persians, and 
continuing into the 2nd and 3rd Centuries, Judaism and 
Christianity were known to have belief systems based on 
one or more gods. Thus, monotheism only gradually devel -
oped among the Abrahamic religions.
Since the monotheistic concept found in the Vedas  is 
much older than the Abrahamic religions, it is only logical 
to conclude that the latter borrowed their thinking from 
the former. During the interim, the Persians, under the 
influence of Zoroaster, took the monotheistic philosophy 
from India and then transmitted it to the Middle Eastern 
civilisations. Indeed, monotheism has always been the cen -
tral theme of India’s Vedic literature.
However, failing to look deeply into the philosophy 
of the Vedas  or possibly being culturally intimidated by 
the superiority of Vedic knowledge as opposed to western 
philosophies and religions, Eurocentric academics and fun -
damental religionists have marginalised the ancient Vedic 
civilisation of India. The German scholar Max Muller 
propagated further misinformation on this subject in the 
19th Century with the invention of the Aryan Invasion 
Theory, stating that Vedic civilisation did not originate in 
India. Yet all this is quite far from the truth.
According to Muller, the åryans  were a nomadic tribe 
from Europe who invaded India. Yet there is no evidence 
that the åryans  were nomads. In fact, to suggest that a 
nomadic tribe of barbarians wrote literature of such pro -
found wisdom as the Vedas  defies imagination.
Furthermore, within the Vedas , there is no mention what -
soever of an original homeland, and archaeologically there 
is a complete lack of evidence to prove an invasion ever 
Bhagavad-gitaoccurred. It can only be concluded that the åryan  people 
and Vedic knowledge were always indigenous to India.
The Vedic knowledge is that Viß√u/K®ß√a is Supreme 
and the lesser gods and goddesses such as Brahmå, Çiva, 
Ga√eça, Kårtikeya, Kålî and Sarasvatî etc. are actually serv -
ants of the Supreme Being and are empowered with the 
duties of managing the universal affairs of material nature. 
In the above verses Çrî K®ß√a recommends that offerings 
should be made to the demigods and thus the demigods 
will be pleased to bestow unto humanity all the necessities 
of life. This is, in short, a universal law of taxation. In 
other words, we must give the demigods their dues.
It is also intrinsic to the nature of the åtmå, to perform 
service and sacrifice. Constitutionally the åtmå, being part 
of the organic whole (the Absolute Truth), is duty-bound 
to serve the whole, both in this life and in eternity. When 
sacrifice or offerings are made to Viß√u such as fruits, veg -
etables etc. then one’s senses become purified by eating the 
remnants of such offerings. But if one takes the things of 
this world without first acknowledging to whom they actu -
ally belong, then one simply incurs a karmic  reaction. This 
also includes our daily food that should first be offered 
to Viß√u/K®ß√a. It will be explained by Çrî K®ß√a later in 
Bhagavad-gîtå  that these food offerings should comprise 
of vegetables, fruits, milk products, flowers etc. Non-veg -
etarian food items cannot be offered to Viß√u or K®ß√a – 
consequently the servants of Viß√u/K®ß√a are vegetarian. 
K®ß√a will also explain that those who serve the Absolute 
Truth are not duty-bound to serve the demigods, nor are 
they bound by any other social consideration.

The Vedic system of political and spiritual leadership is 
that one should lead by example. Unfortunately, in today’s 
world, good leaders of any kind are hard to come by. Not 
only are we disappointed to learn that those we have elected 
to public office are often pilfering the wealth of the coun -
try for their own benefit, but we are even more shocked to 
learn that many of our so-called spiritual leaders cannot 
even maintain the most basic principles of morality and 
engage in abominable, depraved practices.
Çrî K®ß√a states in the above verse that what a great man 
does the common man will follow. This is most evident 
when we observe how movie stars, rock stars, and sports 
personalities influence the majority of people today. That 
we tend to be influenced by others is a human character -
istic, therefore role models are essential. But what human 
society needs are role models that are knowledgeable, cul -
tured, morally principled and spiritually advanced.

– oµ pür√am.  Yet K®ß√a acts; He is not idle. He acts for

hare k®ß√a hare k®ß√a k®ß√a k®ß√a hare hare
hare råma hare råma råma råma hare hare
iti ßo∂açakaµ nåmnåµ kali-kalmaßa nåçanam
nåta˙ parataropåya˙ sarva-vedeßu d®çyate
The sixteen words of this mahå-mantra  are specif -
ically meant for counteracting the contamination 
of Kali-yuga. There is no other way but to chant 
these names of K®ß√a. After searching throughout 
Chapter 389
the Vedic literature one will not find a process for this 
age that is more sublime. ( Kali-santara√a Upanißad 2 )
The transcendental potency of the mahå-mantra  is fur -
ther described as follows in Padma Purå√a :
nåma cintåma√i˙ k®ß√aç caitanya-rasa-vigraha˙
pür√a˙ çuddho nitya-mukto ‘bhinnatvån nåma-nåmino˙
The name of Çrî K®ß√a is a transcendental touch -
stone, full of all transcendental mellows. Complete, 
pure, and eternally liberating, the name of K®ß√a is 
non-different than K®ß√a.
The study of the Bhagavad-gîtå  and the practice of 
sa∫kîrtana  have now spread all over the world. It is no 
longer something that is only available in India. There 
will be more discussion on this particular topic in Chap -
ter 4, verse 8.
The proper mode of action and the proprietor of the 
results of action is only understood when one is free from 
the identification of the self as the body, as being a byprod -
uct of the body or that one is the doer of activities.
We walk, we talk, we digest food, we construct build -
ings and even empires, but all these activities are made 
possible for us by a combination of material nature and 
the Paramåtmå, the Super Consciousness that pervades 
the entire universe. How all this transpires is inconceiva -
ble to those under the bodily conception of life. Thus the 
idea that, “I am this body” arising from the false ego must 
be abandoned. Who are we? Where do we come from? 
Why are we here? Is there life after death? The answers to 
Bhagavad-gitaall these questions begin to fall into place when one gives 
up the concept of the body as the self. Many great thinkers 
from western civilisation have struggled with the ultimate 
questions of life and death, but failed to find the answers 
or the solutions to the problems. This in part was due to 
the fact that they contemplated life under the false premise 
that the body is the self. Self-realisation and realisation of 
the Absolute Truth begins with the abandonment of the 
bodily concept of life."

Chapter 393
Anuv®tti
The faults of material life are many. Herein, Çrî K®ß√a 
has mentioned certain faults that a serious student of the 
Bhagavad-gîtå  should be preeminently aware of. Ignorance, 
foolishness, selfish motivation, a false sense of proprietor -
ship, as well as attraction and aversion to the sense-objects 
are mentioned by K®ß√a. But more dangerous than any 
other fault is envy. Envy, it seems, is purely evil as K®ß√a 
says that those who do not follow the teachings of the 
Bhagavad-gîtå  out of enviousness are bereft of all knowl -
edge and intelligence.
Another danger is the tendency of neglecting one’s own 
duty and trying to perform the duty of another. In other 
words, K®ß√a tells Arjuna to tend to his own business. 
Arjuna is a kßatriya  and his duty, as already discussed, is to 
protect and defend the kingdom. Arjuna however, is show -
ing leanings towards renunciation – becoming a monk, a 
sannyåsî . Arjuna wants to abandon his duty and perform 
that of another, but K®ß√a warns him that this is not a 
good idea. In fact, K®ß√a says it is even dangerous. K®ß√a 
explains that it is better to perform one’s own duty imper -
fectly than perform another’s duty perfectly.
In particular, K®ß√a is encouraging Arjuna to follow the 
codes of conduct set down for kßatriyas  – of which aban -
doning the battlefield for a warrior is not an option."

O mighty armed Arjuna, knowing the individual unit of 
consciousness to be superior to the intelligence, steady the 
mind with the pure intellect of the self and conquer this 
indomitable enemy in the form of lust. 
Anuv®tti
Herein, it is stated that the mind is superior to the 
senses and intelligence is superior to the mind, but above 
the intelligence is the consciousness or åtmå. The mate -
rial body is comprised of the mind, senses and intelligence 
and they are therefore considered as material elements. In 
Chapter 7, verse 4 of Bhagavad-gîtå , Çrî K®ß√a lists the 
eight material elements as earth, water, fire, air, space, 
mind, intelligence and false ego. Then, in the next verse, 
K®ß√a describes a superior energy known as jîva-bhüta , the 
Chapter 397
units of individual consciousness. K®ß√a says that this jîva-
bhüta , also known as åtmå, is categorically different than 
the material elements. It is fully spiritual.
But when lust, the all-devouring enemy of self-reali -
sation, covers the mind, senses and intelligence of the 
superior jîva-bhüta , then the knowledge and realisation of 
the jîva-bhüta  are destroyed. Therefore, K®ß√a says that 
first the yogî must conquer lust. If one does not pursue 
the cravings of lust and instead takes control of one’s 
lower self with one’s higher self, lust will eventually be 
vanquished. However, if one tries to satisfy his burning 
lust then it is like pouring fuel onto a fire.

Arjuna said: You were born only recently and the sun-
god appeared long ago. So how am I to understand that 
in ancient times You had taught him the science of yoga?
Anuv®tti
According to the above statement of Çrî K®ß√a, the 
Bhagavad-gîtå  is a very ancient text. K®ß√a says that previ -
ously He had spoken this knowledge of yoga to Vivasvån, 
the predominating deity of the sun planet, and in turn 
Vivasvån passed on this knowledge to other universal lead -
ers and great kings. This flow of knowledge from one to 
another is called paramparå  or disciplic succession. But in 
time, the knowledge of yoga was lost and therefore K®ß√a 
was again speaking Bhagavad-gîtå  to Arjuna.
The qualifications to properly understand Bhagavad-gîtå  
are stated here. One should be a devotee of K®ß√a and one 
should understand that K®ß√a is suh®dam-sarva-bhütånåm , 
the friend of all living beings. In bhakti-yoga  one does not 
fear God because K®ß√a is not a wrathful God. K®ß√a is 
our dear-most friend and our ever well-wisher. K®ß√a is the 
Chapter 4103
highest subject of love, adoration and affection. K®ß√a also 
has deep feelings of love for His devotees.
From these verses we can also understand that the 
knowledge of yoga is not simply meant for studio lessons. 
The knowledge of yoga is actually the most important 
branch of knowledge in the world and as such, it should 
be studied by every discerning person – from the heads 
of government to the individual citizen. Everyone should 
have the opportunity to study and practice yoga, by which 
one easily approaches the perfection of life.
The question naturally arises in Arjuna’s mind that how 
could K®ß√a have spoken Bhagavad-gîtå  to Vivasvån when 
Vivasvån appeared in the universe millions of years ago 
and K®ß√a only appeared recently?"

Chapter 4105
One who understands My divine appearance and activities 
never takes birth again after giving up this material body. 
He comes to Me, O Arjuna.
Anuv®tti
To understand Çrî K®ß√a’s appearance and activities 
is indeed to become situated beyond the cycle of birth 
and death. In material life all living beings are in a per -
petual state of transmigration from one birth to the next. 
Only when one attains pure spiritual consciousness does 
saµsåra , or transmigration, cease. K®ß√a tells Arjuna that 
both of them have passed through many births that Arjuna 
has forgotten, but K®ß√a remembers them all.
Because the living beings change bodies at the time of 
death, they also forget their previous lives. K®ß√a is the 
Absolute Truth and thus He does not change His body or 
transmigrate to another body at any time. Because He does 
not undergo a change of body He does not forget. K®ß√a 
is non-different from His body, whereas living beings in 
material life are units of consciousness that are embod -
ied by material elements. The bodies of all living beings 
in the material world are made of the basic elements of 
earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intelligence and false 
ego. K®ß√a is sac-cid-ånanda  – eternity, knowledge and 
bliss. K®ß√a’s body is also sac-cid-ånanda , thus K®ß√a and 
K®ß√a’s body are non-different. They are transcendental, 
spiritual substances.
Çrî K®ß√a not only remembers all His previous births, 
but He remembers all of Arjuna’s previous births also. 
This is the characteristic of the Absolute Truth who is 
fully omniscient.
Bhagavad-gitaThe knowledge of yoga being lost naturally results in 
a decline in dharma  and a rise of adharma  (false dharma ). 
Malevolence arises out of adharma . When this occurs, 
K®ß√a says that He appears in the world to re-establish 
the principles of dharma . Dharma  is understood as duties, 
activities and practices that will sustain the living beings 
in a state of prosperity and enable them to realise their 
constitutional position as conscious parts and parcels of 
the Absolute Truth, K®ß√a. As such, dharma  should not be 
confused with the mundane religions of this world.
In verse 8 K®ß√a says that He appears in every age ( yuge 
yuge) to establish the  yuga-dharma . In Satya-yuga, K®ß√a 
appeared as Haµsa, Matsya, Kürma, Varåha and Nar -
asiµha avatåras . In Treta-yuga, He appeared as Våmana, 
Paraçuråma and Råmacandra avatåras.  In Dvåpara-yuga, He 
appeared as Çrî K®ß√a and in Kali-yuga, He has appeared as 
Buddha and Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu. There is one more 
avatåra  yet to appear at the end of Kali-yuga, some 427,000 
years from now, and that is Kalki.
When K®ß√a was speaking Bhagavad-gîtå , it was at the 
end of Dvåpara-yuga – an age of considerable piety where 
open degradation such as establishments for the consump -
tion of alcohol, illicit sex, political corruption, drug abuse 
and the organised slaughter of animals were completely 
unheard of. Now, five thousand years on, we are in the 
midst of the age known as Kali-yuga where the unheard of 
vices in Dvåpara-yuga are the norm of the day. 
Similarly, as K®ß√a had appeared at the end of Dvåpa -
ra-yuga, He again appeared after the first 4,576 years 
of Kali-yuga had passed as the avatåra , Çrî Caitanya 
Mahåprabhu. Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu is also known as 
Chapter 4107
the Kali-yuga avatåra , or the yugåvatåra . As the yugåvatåra , 
K®ß√a taught the dharma  of nåma-sa∫kîrtana , the chant -
ing of the mahå-mantra  as not only the most important 
process of self-realisation, but as the only recommended 
process of self-realisation in Kali-yuga. Conclusively, the 
B®han-Nåradîya Purå√a (38.126)  says:
harer-nåma harer-nåma harer-nåma eva kevalam
kalau nåsty-eva nåsty-eva nåsty-eva gatir anyathå
In the age of Kali there is no other way, there is 
no other way, there is no other way except for the 
chanting of the names of K®ß√a.
When the mahå-mantra  is chanted congregationally in 
a loud tone, it is called kîrtana  or sa∫kîrtana . When the 
mahå-mantra  is chanted softly and the repetition is counted 
on a string of one hundred-and eight beads, it is called japa.
Since the advent of Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu and the 
sa∫kîrtana  movement, many great and learned scholars, 
philosophers and yogîs such as Sårvabhauma Bha††åcårya 
and Prakåçånanda Sarasvatî have put aside other systems 
of yoga, Vedånta  and philosophy in favour of becoming 
fully absorbed in the chanting of the holy names of K®ß√a. 
According to great self-realised personalities, the chanting 
of the mahå-mantra  is the surest path to spiritual perfec -
tion in this age. Çrîmad Bhågavatam  states as follows:
kaler doßa nidhe råjann asti hy eko mahån gu√a˙
kîrtanåd eva k®ß√asya mukta-sa∫ga˙ paraµ vrajet
Although Kali-yuga is an ocean of faults where 
people are short-lived, slow and always disturbed, 
Bhagavad-gitastill there is one great quality about this age – simply 
by chanting the name of K®ß√a, one can be delivered 
from material bondage and attain the supreme desti -
nation. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam 12.3.51)
k®te yad dhyåyato viß√uµ tretåyåµ yajato makhai˙
dvåpare paricaryåyåµ kalau taddhari-kîrtanåt
Whatever results were gained in Satya-yuga by med -
itating upon Viß√u, in Treta-yuga by performing 
elaborate sacrifices and in Dvåpara-yuga by Deity 
worship can be obtained in Kali-yuga simply by 
chanting the names of K®ß√a. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam 
12.3.52)
The chanting of the mahå-mantra  advances one in 
self-realisation because it purifies the heart of material 
influences and eliminates the false conceptions of life, 
thus terminating the cycle of birth and death. Çrî Caitanya 
Mahåprabhu has composed a verse wherein the benefits of 
sa∫kîrtana , chanting the mahå-mantra , have been described 
as follows:
ceto-darpa√a-mårjanaµ bhava mahå-dåvågni nirvåpa√aµ
çreya˙ -kairava-candrikå-vitara√aµ vidyå-vadhü-jîvanam
ånandåmbudhi-vardhanaµ prati-padaµ pür√åm®tåsvådanaµ
sarvåtma-snapanaµ paraµ vijayate çrî k®ß√a-sa∫kîrtanam
The holy name of K®ß√a cleanses the mirror of the 
heart and extinguishes the fire of misery in the forest 
of birth and death. Just as the evening lotus blooms 
in the moon’s cooling rays, the heart begins to blos -
som in the nectar of K®ß√a’s name. And at last the 
Chapter 4109
åtmå awakens to its real inner treasure – a life of 
love with K®ß√a. Again and again tasting nectar, the 
åtmå dives and surfaces in the ever-increasing ocean 
of ecstatic joy. All phases of the self of which we 
may conceive are fully satisfied and purified, and at 
last conquered by the all-auspicious influence of the 
holy name of K®ß√a. ( Çikßåß†aka  1)
Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu taught the chanting of the 
mahå-mantra  and a complete system of philosophy known 
as acintya-bhedåbheda-tattva  that has encompassed all the 
great philosophical systems of India that preceded Him, 
such as Ådi Ça∫kara’s advaita , Viß√u Svåmî’s çuddhådvaita , 
Nimbårka’s dvaitådvaita , Råmånuja’s viçiß†hådvaita  and 
Madhva’s dvaita . The acintya-bhedåbheda-tattva  philoso -
phy is essentially the philosophy of simultaneous oneness 
and difference in the Absolute Truth, culminating in pre-
ma-bhakti  or divine love. As such, Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu 
has revealed the greatest philosophy of spiritual perfection 
in this world.
To accompany the chanting of the mahå-mantra  the 
process of Deity worship that was prominent in Dvåpa -
ra-yuga is still in vogue today. The Deity is the arca-vi -
graha  representation of Çrî K®ß√a that is manifest before 
the aspirant so that one can perform arcana  (worship) 
and fix the mind and senses on the form of the Supreme 
Person. When the authorised arca-vigraha  is present, such 
worship should not be confused with the worship of life -
less and unauthorised idols. Current in the communities 
of bhakti-yoga  are the worship of the arca-vigrahas  of Çrî 
K®ß√a such as Jagannåtha, Pañca-tattva, Gaura-Nitåi, Gau -
ra-Gadådhara, Çrî Narasiµha and Çrî Çrî Rådhå-K®ß√a.

Bhagavad-gitaAnuv®tti
In verse 10 Çrî K®ß√a alludes to the topmost stage of 
self-realisation by the use of the word bhåva . Bhåva  is the 
stage of deep affection just before one reaches the stage of 
purest love, prema . Rüpa Gosvåmî, the foremost disciple of 
Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu, explains this in great detail in 
his book, Bhakti-rasåm®ta-sindhu  (1.4.15-16).
ådau çraddhå tata˙ sådhu-sa∫go‘tha bhajana-kriyå
tato’nartha-niv®tti˙ syåt tato niß†hå rucis tata˙
athåsaktis tato bhåvas-tata˙ premåbhyudañcati,
sådhakånåm ayaµ prem√a˙ prådurbhåve bhavet krama˙
The development of transcendental love begins with 
çraddhå  or faith. Çraddhå  leads one to associate with 
spiritually advanced persons, sådhu-sa∫ga . In the 
association of sådhus  one receives çikßa, or instruc -
tions on how to approach the Absolute Truth, and 
gradually one is initiated into this process. This 
is called bhajana-kriyå.  When the heart is cleared 
of contamination, one reaches the stage of being 
pure-hearted ( anartha-niv®tti ). By the cultivation 
of spiritual practices after achieving anartha-niv®tti,  
one becomes steady ( niß†ha ), and achieves the state of 
ruci, wherein one begins to taste the pure sweetness 
of realisation in the Absolute Truth. This ruci devel -
ops further to become åsakti,  or great attachment 
for the Absolute. Great attachment for the Absolute 
gradually manifests as great feelings of affection for 
Çrî K®ß√a. This is called bhåva.  And the mature stage 
of those feelings of affection are known as prema,  
or the sentiments of transcendental love for K®ß√a.
Chapter 4113
It is interesting to note that K®ß√a hints at this ulti -
mate perfection early on in Bhagavad-gîtå,  not too overtly 
but slightly covertly – for love, after all, is the greatest of 
all secrets.
In subsequent verses, K®ß√a continues to encourage 
Arjuna not to adopt the path of inaction. K®ß√a assures 
Arjuna that He is transcendental to all types of karma  and 
that those who take refuge in Him also become liberated 
from the reactions of material activities.
K®ß√a wants Arjuna to follow the example of pre -
viously liberated persons – to follow in their footsteps, 
mahåjano yena gata˙ sa panthå˙.  In ancient times there were 
many great personalities known as mahåjanas  and they all 
achieved liberation from birth and death by taking shelter 
of K®ß√a. K®ß√a wants Arjuna to follow these mahåjanas .
Çrî K®ß√a is awarding all living beings accordingly as 
they approach Him. Knowingly or unknowingly everyone 
is searching for K®ß√a. K®ß√a is the reservoir of pleasure 
and the primeval cause of everything. In Brahma-saµhitå , 
Çrî K®ß√a is described as sarva-kåra√a-kåra√am , the cause 
of all causes. K®ß√a is also known as Govinda, or one who 
gives pleasure to the senses. But due to being under the 
illusion of bodily consciousness, the living beings are not 
aware of what is actually in their best interest, therefore 
they do not approach K®ß√a directly. Instead, the bewil -
dered living beings worship demigods for the fulfilment 
of their desires, or as in modern society, they simply work 
hard to earn money and purchase whatever they want.
In material existence, the living beings are wandering 
throughout the universe in different species of life, expe -
riencing happiness and distress according to their karma .
Bhagavad-gitabrahmå√∂a bhramite kona bhågyavån jîva
guru-k®ß√a-prasåde påya bhakti-latå-bîja
Out of millions of wandering living beings, one who 
is most fortunate gets an opportunity to associate 
with a liberated person (guru) by the grace of K®ß√a. 
By the mercy of K®ß√a and the guru, such a person 
receives the seed of the creeper of bhakti . (Caitan -
ya-caritåm®ta, Madhya-lîlå  19.151)
The world is old – much older than many of us real -
ise and many things have changed over the ages. Yet the 
basic principles of spiritual advancement and putting an 
end to the problems of birth, death, old age and disease 
remain the same. The advancement of modern civilisation 
has actually done very little to solve the real problems of 
life. We are given so-called higher education and better 
standards of living, yet the basic problems remain – birth, 
death, old age and disease. Now the real solution is at hand 
and Çrî K®ß√a wants Arjuna to accept it.
To facilitate social harmony, efficiency and advance -
ment in spiritual life, K®ß√a has created the four social 
orders in society called var√as . According to one’s suk®ti , 
or spiritual merits derived from previous lifetimes, one 
comes to the human form of life with certain innate qual -
ities. This is a natural system of order in the universe and 
it is perceivable in all civilised societies. These human 
tendencies are grouped into four basic classifications: the 
intellectual, martial, mercantile and labourer classes. The 
Vedic terms for these are bråhma√as , kßatriyas , vaiçyas  and 
çüdras . According to Çrî K®ß√a these var√as  are determined 
by one’s qualities and actions ( gu√a-karma ) and not simply 
Chapter 4115
by birth. One may be born in the family of workmen but 
show extraordinary intellectual prowess and so forth. As 
such, one is to be heartily welcomed into the intellectual 
community. Similarly, one may be born to a wealthy mer -
cantile family but show great promise as a military leader. 
Thus one is encouraged to follow that line of work.
When one performs the work prescribed to him accord -
ing to his qualities, and devotes that work to please the 
Supreme Person K®ß√a, then such a person achieves the 
highest perfection. This is confirmed as follows:
ata˙ pumbhir dvija-çreß†hå var√åçrama-vibhågaça˙
svanuß†hitasya dharmasya saµsiddhir hari-toßa√am
It is concluded that the highest perfection one can 
achieve by discharging one’s occupational duties 
according to the var√a and åçrama  orders of life is 
to please K®ß√a. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam  1.2.13)
Unfortunately, in modern times some persons have 
given a wrong interpretation to the eligibility of the var√as  
by placing all emphasis on one’s birth in a particular 
family. This has been invented to create a sense of social 
superiority wherein elite members of Vedic society who 
are born as bråhma√as  and kßatriyas  are given special priv -
ileges, while others who are born as vaiçyas  and çüdras  are 
not. This system has created havoc in India for more than 
one thousand years and is known as the caste system. The 
caste system however is a total misrepresentation of the 
system of var√as  created by K®ß√a.

Anuv®tti
We have already discussed previously the different types 
of action such as karma  (prescribed duties), vikarma  (for-
bidden actions) and akarma  (spiritual activities). None -
theless it is sometimes difficult to understand the different 
types of action, and especially to see inaction in action 
and action within inaction. Indeed, this seems quite con -
tradictory. In contemporary society, especially in various 
yoga communities, karma  is often spoken of without a clear 
understanding of what it actually is or how it is incurred.
Chapter 4119
The point Çrî K®ß√a wants to make clear is that actions 
performed for His satisfaction do not have any reaction 
in the sphere of karma  or vikarma . Actions performed 
for K®ß√a are in the category of akarma , producing only 
spiritual benefit – no good or bad material effect. Good 
and bad karma  are both material and as such they must 
be shaken off before one can become spiritually liberated.
Generally we want good karma,  but good karma  means 
we will have to take birth again and enjoy its good effects. 
Bad karma , of course, is commonly understood as some -
thing undesirable or to be avoided because it causes suffer -
ing, pain and distress. This is certainly true, but bad karma  
is simply the flip side of good karma  and vice versa. This 
is called the karmic  entanglement of material life – some -
times enjoying and sometimes suffering.
Akarma  leads to liberation from all material entangle -
ment and takes one to the plane of eternal blissful life in 
full knowledge of everything. While engaging in yoga,  a 
serious student should, as far as possible, lead a simple life 
beyond duality by minimizing material hankerings, con -
trolling the mind and body and giving up possessiveness. 
Being content with that which comes of its own accord, 
one should remain steadfast in the practice of yoga."

Anuv®tti
The above verses principally deal with sacrifice and sac -
rifices of different types. However, it should be mentioned 
at the outset that Çrî K®ß√a does not recommend animal 
sacrifices. The very word ‘sacrifice’ conjures up images of 
bloodshed – and rightfully so. In the history of religions 
throughout the world, from antiquity to modernity, the 
sacrifice of both animals and humans has been a common 
practice. Most progressive thinkers however now view 
Chapter 4123
human and animal sacrifice as totally repugnant and cer -
tainly Çrî K®ß√a would be in complete agreement.
The sacrifices mentioned here by K®ß√a mainly concern 
the performance of austerities, breath control, study of the 
Vedas , purification of knowledge, renunciation, observing 
vows etc. The purpose of all such sacrifices is to advance 
in realisation of the Absolute Truth.
It is often said that, “God is one” or that, “It is all 
one”. This is true, but there is a need to qualify such state -
ments. God is the Absolute Truth, one without a second, 
but this does not mean that all living beings are God. The 
Bhagavad-gîtå  is straightforward on the point that all living 
beings are eternally individual and never become God at 
any time. Similarly, God is always the Absolute Truth and 
nothing less.
It is said in verse 24 that the utensils of sacrifice are 
Absolute, the sacred fire is Absolute, the priest or per -
former of sacrifice is Absolute and one who is always 
absorbed in thoughts of the Absolute attains the Absolute. 
This is not to say that the individuality of any of these is 
lost in the Absolute. Everything that comes in contact with 
the Absolute Truth acquires the qualities of the Absolute 
by association, but the individuality of each is maintained.
The point is also made that practically everything in 
life depends on sacrifice, even worldly pleasures. Without 
sacrifice one cannot enjoy in this life or in the next. The 
knowledge of performing sacrifice is essential for the stu -
dents of yoga. Knowing this one becomes liberated.

As per the understanding of advanced students and mas -
ters of Bhagavad-gîtå,  Çrî K®ß√a’s instruction in verse 34 is 
that one should try to understand the truth by approaching 
a tattva-darçî , one who has seen the truth, with an attitude 
Bhagavad-gitaof submissive inquiry ( paripraçna ) and service ( sevå). Being 
satisfied by such submissive inquiry and service, the tatt-
va-darçî  will instruct and initiate the disciple in the sacred 
science of yoga. In other words, K®ß√a is telling Arjuna 
that to know the truth he must approach a spiritual master 
(guru) and become his disciple.
guru-pådåçrayas-tasmåt k®ß√a-dîkßådi-çikßa√am
viçrambhe√a guro˙ sevå sådhu-vartmånu-vartanam
Firstly one must surrender at the feet of the guru, 
receive training from him by accepting spiritual initi -
ation and instructions regarding Çrî K®ß√a, serve the 
guru with affection and follow in the footsteps of the 
sådhus . (Bhakti-rasåm®ta-sindhu  1.2.74)
As the representative of K®ß√a, the instruction of the 
guru, or åcårya , should be heeded. The genuine guru is a 
representative of K®ß√a (Paramåtmå) and is of two types – 
dîkßå  and çikßå. The dîkßå -guru gives initiation and accepts 
the student or disciple as a member of the paramparå.  Such 
initiations are not secret and are held in plain view of the 
public, but at the initiation ceremony the disciple receives 
the mahå-mantra  and gåyatrî-mantras for meditation. The 
çikßå-guru  is one who imparts practical instructions to the 
disciple for the progressive advancement in self-realisation. 
The function of dîkßå  and çikßå may be performed by the 
same guru, or by different gurus, but in any case both the 
dîkßå  and çikßå gurus must be representatives of K®ß√a. 
Thus, one should see the guru as non-different from K®ß√a 
and should offer him all respect. K®ß√a confirms this in  
Çrîmad Bhågavatam  as follows:
Chapter 4127
åcåryaµ måµ vijånîyån nåvamanyeta karhicit
na martya-buddhyåsüyeta sarva-deva-mayo guru˙
One should consider the åcårya (guru) as non-dif -
ferent from Myself and never show any disrespect 
towards him. One should not envy him, nor con -
sider him to be an ordinary person as he is the rep -
resentative of all the demigods. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam  
11.17.27)
This is the guru-disciple relationship that has been 
accepted since time immemorial. However, the question 
arises as to who is a guru? What are the qualifications of 
a guru? It is clear that the disciple’s mood should be one 
of eagerness to know the truth accompanied by submissive 
inquiry and service. But what of the guru – what are his 
qualifications?
The Bhagavad-gîtå  says that the guru must be one 
who has seen the truth (a tattva-darçî ) and who knows 
the science of K®ß√a consciousness. This presupposes 
that the guru is himself a disciple of the previous guru. 
This is known as the guru-paramparå  or the guru-disci -
ple succession. Bhagavad-gîtå  sets the standards to acquire 
entrance into knowledge of the Absolute Truth and what 
that Truth is. K®ß√a is the principle speaker of the Bhaga -
vad-gîtå  and therefore the guru must necessarily be in the 
paramparå  of K®ß√a.
The first qualification of the guru is that he must be 
in an authentic paramparå  and he must teach his disciple 
the principles and conclusions of Bhagavad-gîtå . There are 
four paramparås  and one should learn the philosophy of 
Bhagavad-gitaBhagavad-gîtå  from one of those paramparås . Çrî Baladeva 
Vidyåbhüßa√a has mentioned these four paramparås  in his 
book Prameya-ratnåvalî :
sampradåya vihînå ye mantrås te nißphalå matå˙
ata˙ kalau bhavißyanti catvåra˙ sampradåyina˙
çrî brahma rudra sanakå˙ vaiß√avå˙ kßiti-påvanå˙
catvåras te kalau bhåvyå hy-utkale purußottamåt
råmånujaµ çrî˙ svîcakre madhvåcåryaµ catur-mukha˙
çrî viß√u-svåminaµ rudro nimbådityaµ catu˙sana˙
That mantra  that is not received in a disciplic suc -
cession does not produce any result. Thus, in Kali-
yuga there are four sampradåyas (paramparås ). They 
are the Çrî, Brahmå, Rudra and Sanaka sampradåyas. 
Råmånuja is the åcårya  of the Çrî sampradåya , 
Madhva is the åcårya  of the Brahmå sampradåya, 
Viß√u Svåmî is the åcårya  of the Rudra sampradåya  
and Nimbåditya is the åcårya  of the Sanaka sam-
pradåya.  (Prameya-ratnåvalî  1.5-7)
The Vedas  conclude that Çrî K®ß√a is the Absolute 
Truth and all living beings are His parts and parcels. The 
Ka†ha Upanißad states:
nityo’nityånåµ cetanaç cetanånåm
eko bahünåµ yo vidadhåti kåmån
He is the Prime Eternal amongst all eternals. He 
is the Supreme Conscious Being amongst conscious 
beings, and He alone is maintaining all life. ( Ka†ha 
Upanißad  2.2.13)
Chapter 4129
However, despite this, unscrupulous persons still 
attempt to make a trade with K®ß√a’s words in Bhaga -
vad-gîtå  and instead of declaring K®ß√a to be the Supreme 
Conscious Being, they put themselves forward as being 
K®ß√a or God incarnate. Such so-called gurus are actu -
ally not gurus, but cheaters. This is explained by Çiva in 
Padma Purå√a :
guravo bahava˙ santi çißya-vittåpa hårakå˙
durlabha˙ sad-gurur devî çißya-santåpa håraka˙
There are many gurus who will take the wealth of 
their disciples, but it is rare to find a true guru who 
will remove the ignorance and miseries of a disciple.
The cheaters make a big show of spiritual advancement 
but in reality they are spiritually bankrupt. Only a genuine 
representative of K®ß√a can be guru or a teacher of the 
Bhagavad-gîtå.  This is the conclusion of all tattva-darçîs."

Anuv®tti
The Vedic system recommends four spiritual orders 
of life called åçråmas . These are brahmacårî, g®hastha, 
vånaprastha  and sannyåsa . Brahmacårîs  are the celibate stu -
dents. G®hasthas are the family units, vånaprasthas  are the 
retired members of society and sannyåsîs  are the completely 
Chapter 5137
renounced persons who live a life of sacrifice, austerity and 
cultivation of knowledge. Sannyåsîs  are considered to be at 
the crest of all social and spiritual orders of life.
Vedic scholars sometimes debate whether sannyå -
sa-yoga  (complete renunciation of activities) or karma-yoga  
(actions performed selflessly) is better. Çrî K®ß√a says in 
Bhagavad-gîtå  that both sannyåsa-yoga  and karma-yoga  are 
favourable for liberation. Both paths ultimately lead to the 
same goal, but of the two, the path of karma-yoga  is pref -
erable. This subject is controversial among some scholars 
because, according to their understanding, karma-yoga  is 
the performance of philanthropic works that are beneficial 
to the downtrodden section of society such as the poor and 
the hungry. Such welfare work is indeed noble, but one 
should understand that when K®ß√a speaks of karma-yoga  
in the Gîtå,  He is specifically speaking about activities 
that are performed for His satisfaction and pleasure. Such 
activities are also known as karma-yoga  or bhakti-yoga  
because the result of action is offered to K®ß√a. In other 
words, noble philanthropic activities are ‘good karma’  but 
not karma-yoga,  unless they are offered to K®ß√a and per -
formed on His behalf.
When karma-yoga  is established as bhakti-yoga  then 
its superior advantage over sannyåsa-yoga  is immediately 
understood. Sannyåsa-yoga  is very, very difficult to exe -
cute. One has to strictly control the senses and renounce 
even the simplest comforts of life such as a warm bath, 
comfortable sleeping place etc. One has to live in the 
forest, fast regularly and observe other austerities such as 
sexual abstinence. For most people, this is very difficult, 
if not impossible.
Bhagavad-gitaKarma-yoga  (bhakti-yoga ) on the other hand, is easily 
adoptable by anyone at any stage and leads quickly to the 
ultimate goal of life. In karma-yoga  one performs devo -
tional activities and follows basic principles of purity such 
as no intoxication, no illicit sex, no gambling and no eating 
of meat, fish or eggs. These principles can be easily adopted 
by anyone. Similarly, the devotional activity of chanting 
the mahå-mantra  (hare k®ß√a hare k®ß√a k®ß√a k®ß√a hare 
hare, hare råma hare råma råma råma hare hare ) is also 
easily taken up along with meditation on the form of Çrî 
K®ß√a. Mantra meditation is the recommended process of 
worshipping K®ß√a in Kali-yuga. Therefore karma-yoga  is 
given first preference in Bhagavad-gîtå .
However, when  sannyåsa-yoga  is dovetailed with kar-
ma-yoga  and the  sannyåsî  performs any and all sacrifices, 
austerities and shares the knowledge of  Bhagavad-gîtå  with 
others, according to the desires of K®ß√a, then such a san-
nyåsî  becomes most perfect and is naturally accepted as the 
guru or teacher of both paths."

Anuv®tti
In verse 15 the word vibhu  has been translated as 
Supreme Spirit. Vibhu  literally means ‘omnipresent’ and 
this refers to Çrî K®ß√a, the Supreme Conscious Being. 
When consciousness is omnipresent the conclusion is 
that it is omniscient also. Omniscience and omnipresence 
denote K®ß√a. Arjuna however, and other living beings of 
his status, are called anu or finite. K®ß√a, the Absolute 
Truth, is infinite and the living beings are finite.
Bhagavad-gitaIt is sometimes thought that God, somehow or other, 
dies for the sins of the world. This is not a very intelligent 
idea, nor is it consistent with the spiritual science found in 
Bhagavad-gîtå . K®ß√a says that He does not cause anyone 
to perform pious or impious activities nor does he accept 
the reaction of anyone’s actions. The idea that God dies 
for our sins is rejected. God is eternal; therefore He cannot 
and does not die. The living beings are also eternal, but 
because they are under the bodily concept of life, when 
the body dies they also experience death – although they 
actually do not die. Both the Absolute Truth and His parts 
and parcels are eternal, beyond death.
In verse 18 the relative vision of equality is expressed 
for one who is situated in transcendental knowledge. The 
wise man ( pa√∂ita ) sees all living beings equally, as units 
of eternal consciousness. The distinction between vari -
ous bodies is only an apparent difference between living 
beings. According to the  B®had-Viß√u Purå√a, there are 
8,400,000 different species of material bodies:
jalajå nava-lakßå√i sthåvarå lakßa-viµçati˙
k®mayo rudra-sa∫khyakå˙ pakßinåµ daça-lakßakam
 triµçal-lakßå√i paçavaç-catur-lakßå√i månußå˙
There are 900,000 aquatic species and 2,000,000 
non-moving species such as trees and plants. There 
are 1,100,000 species of insects and reptiles and 
1,000,000 species of birds. There are 3,000,000 
varieties of quadrupeds and 400,000 species of 
human beings.
The unit of individual consciousness, the åtmå, transmi -
grates through these various species from one to the other 
Chapter 5145
until it eventually reaches the human form of life. This 
process is known as transmigration, or reincarnation. It is 
similar to the theory of evolution, but distinctly different 
at the same time. In the Vedic concept the species of life 
are not evolving one into the other (though change within 
species is accepted), rather it is the åtmå that is evolving in 
consciousness while transmigrating from one species to the 
next. In the human form of life, consciousness reaches its 
completeness through the process of yoga.
Therefore, a wise man does not discriminate between 
one person and another based on bodily differences. The 
wise see the åtmå present in all forms of life and not just 
in human life."

One attains peace by knowing Me to be the original 
enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Con -
troller of all the planets, and the benefactor and friend of 
all living beings.
Anuv®tti
In the last verse of this chapter Çrî K®ß√a declares that 
He is bhoktåraµ yajña-tapasåµ , the ultimate enjoyer and 
receiver of all sacrifice and austerities. K®ß√a then says that 
He is sarva-loka-maheçvaram , the Controller of all planets.
Some modern systems of yoga recommend that one med -
itate by thinking of oneself to be controlling and moving 
the planets. This is completely absurd. When one is unable 
to control the affairs of the world that surrounds him, how 
then is he able to control the movements of the planets? 
This is not actually meditation – it is self-deception.
Çrî K®ß√a concludes by saying that He is suh®daµ sar -
va-bhütånåµ , the true friend of all living beings. By far, 
the K®ß√a conception of the Absolute Truth is the broad -
est, most complete, in-depth and convincing idea of God 
known to human society. There are many conceptions of 
the ultimate source of life being the all-powerful creator 
and controller of the universe, but the K®ß√a conception 
is the only concept of ultimate reality that embraces a love 
affair with God as a dear-most friend. This is exclusive 
Chapter 5149
to the K®ß√a conception, therefore it is considered as the 
topmost theology, or topmost yoga system.
K®ß√a says, jñåtvå måµ çåntim ®cchati – knowing this, 
one attains peace. If ever there were something that was 
elusive in this world then certainly it is peace. Peace is 
talked about everywhere but it is rare, if not impossible 
to find. Bhagavad-gîtå  gives us a key to peace. Peace is not 
found in becoming rich and famous, in being saved or even 
liberated from birth and death – real peace comes from 
knowing that Çrî K®ß√a is our dear-most friend. This is the 
message of Bhagavad-gîtå .

Anuv®tti
Many commentators on Bhagavad-gîtå  have mentioned 
that the method of meditation spoken of in the Sixth 
Chapter is derived from the eightfold process of yoga 
known as aß†å∫ga-yoga . The famous compiler of the Yoga-
sütras , Patañjali has explained the sequential order of the 
aß†å∫ga-yoga  system as follows: 
First, one should practice yama  that consists of obser -
vances such as rising from bed before sunrise, taking bath, 
study of the Vedas  and performing püjå (rituals). 
Niyama  consists of controlling the senses by following 
regulative principles such as no intoxication, no illicit sex, 
no gambling and no eating of meat, fish or eggs. 
Next one begins the practice of åsana  by physically 
conditioning the body through systematic bodily exercises 
and postures aimed at toning and bringing into balance 
one’s entire physical organism. 
Bhagavad-gitaThen one advances to the performance of prå√åyåma , 
controlling the inward and outward breath by systematic 
breathing exercises performed in conjunction with vari -
ous åsanas . When åsanas  and prå√åyåma  are performed 
or taught just for the sake of health, this is sometimes 
called ha†ha-yoga .
After prå√åyåma  follows pratyåhåra,  or withdrawing 
the senses from the sense-objects and training the mind to 
become introspective and intuitively orientated. Then one 
is able to concentrate the mind on a single point without 
being disturbed. This is known as dhåra√å,  or attaining 
concentration. 
Once having acquired the ability to concentrate the 
mind without distractions from external sources, one can 
begin actual meditation, or dhyåna . There are many forms 
of meditation in the yoga system, however none of them 
recommend concentrating on nothingness. The three prin -
ciple objects of meditation in yoga are Brahman (transcen -
dental light), Paramåtmå (localised Super Consciousness) 
and Bhagavån (Çrî K®ß√a).
Samådhi  is the final stage of aß†å∫ga-yoga  wherein the 
yogî, at the time of quitting the material body, attains the 
object of his desired perfection. The yogîs who desire Brah -
man or Paramåtmå realisation enter the brahma-jyoti  after 
giving up their body and the yogî who desires Bhagavån 
realisation enters into the Supreme Abode of K®ß√a known 
as Vaiku√†ha or Goloka V®ndåvana to associate with and 
participate in transcendental pastimes with K®ß√a.
According to many masters of yoga, only Bhagavån real -
isation is eternal. Even after attaining Brahman or Para -
måtmå realisations and merging into the Supreme Brahman, 
Chapter 6157
a yogî will once again have to come back to the material 
world and begin again the cycle of birth and death. This 
is said to be due to the intrinsic nature of all living beings 
to perform activities. Although in the brahma-jyoti  there 
is a sense of bliss that is many thousands of times greater 
than material happiness, still the desire to act remains. But 
because the Brahman realised yogî and the Paramåtmå real -
ised yogî are not qualified to perform devotional activities 
in the association of K®ß√a, they cannot enter the spiritual 
planets and must therefore come down to take birth again 
in the material world."

Çrî K®ß√a again informs Arjuna in verse 15 that the final 
goal of yoga is to attain His Supreme Abode (Vaiku√†ha 
or Goloka V®ndåvana). This is indeed the ultimate goal of 
the yoga system.
One cannot be a yogî if one eats too much or not 
enough. Eating too much also means eating things like 
non-vegetarian foodstuff to maintain the body. This is not 
actually required. Nor can one be a yogî if one does not eat 
enough. This also means that one should not abstain from 
eating milk products by considering it as non-vegetarian. 
Milk is the most complete food possible. Milk products 
help to develop a strong bodily constitution and nourish 
our brain cells and thus our thinking capacity. Yoga is 
something that has been practiced in India for thousands 
of years and from then until now, yogîs have recommended 
taking milk and milk products like yogurt and cheese etc. 
Only in recent times have some people thought it bad to 
Chapter 6161
take milk products, but the masters of yoga have never rec -
ommended such abnegation.
Proper sitting posture, control of the senses and observ -
ing celibacy are also recommended in the above verses 
because without such practices no one can actually be a 
yogî. Gazing at the tip of the nose without casting one’s 
glance in other directions means being perfectly concen -
trated, as in dhåra√å,  and performing dhyåna , or medita -
tion on K®ß√a as the highest goal.
As far as possible, a yogî should try to live in a holy 
place to practice yoga. In India yogîs are fond of residing on 
the banks of the Ganges at Haridvåra, H®ßîkeça, Benares, 
or Måyåpura, or on the banks of another sacred river like 
the Yamunå, Kåverî or Godåvarî. Some yogîs prefer the 
sanctuary of the Himålayas, others prefer residence in the 
cåra-dhåma  (Dvårakå, Badarînåtha, Jagannåtha Purî and 
Råmeçvaram). In any case, the yogî must choose the proper 
place to practice yoga. 
If one is unable to live in a holy place or on the banks 
of a sacred river, then one should try to live in an åçrama  
or yoga community. If one is unable to live in a yoga com -
munity then one should sanctify one’s home by creating a 
place where K®ß√a can be worshipped and mantra  medita -
tion can be performed. The home should have an atmos -
phere conducive for contemplation, study and controlling 
the senses. Such a home should be peaceful and free from 
acts of violence, animal killing, intoxication etc.
In this modern age (Kali-yuga) animal killing, intoxi -
cation and so many other unfavourable activities are to be 
found everywhere. Subsequently, it is very difficult to find 
the appropriate place for yoga practice, especially for the 
Bhagavad-gitapractice of aß†å∫ga-yoga , råja-yoga , ha†ha-yoga  and so on. 
Therefore, in Kali-yuga the recommended process is bhak-
ti-yoga  and meditation is performed through the chanting 
of the mahå-mantra .
hare k®ß√a hare k®ß√a k®ß√a k®ß√a hare hare
hare råma hare råma råma råma hare hare
The chanting of the mahå-mantra  is so powerful and 
purifying that, wherever it is chanted, it makes that place 
purified. Thus the bhakti-yoga  process can be practiced 
everywhere and anywhere. Bhakti-yoga  is actually the only 
recommended process of yoga in Kali-yuga.
The yogî must always strive for self-satisfaction, knowl -
edge and realisation. Such a yogî will always see everything 
in this world with equal vision and therefore will not 
become attached to anything of a temporary nature. K®ß√a 
says that the yogî sees gold and mere stones as the same. 
This is not to say that the yogî cannot distinguish the bril -
liance of gold from that of ordinary objects; this means 
that the yogî is not attracted to finding satisfaction in the 
accumulation of wealth.
It has been said that the desire for wealth is what makes 
the world go round. This may be true in the sense that the 
desire for wealth is what drives most people to act. Sadly 
we also see clearly where greed for wealth is taking the 
world today – political unrest culminating in war, death 
and destruction, economic instability and collapse as well 
as extreme instability in the environment. This results in 
natural disasters and the extinction of many species of life.

one can perceive the self and attain happiness. Being sit -

Control of the mind is quintessential for the practice of 
yoga. The problem arises due to the very nature of the mind 
itself. The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady; it 
wants to wander here and there from one sense-object to 
the next. Even in sleep the wandering mind is active. But 
Çrî K®ß√a says that the yogî must always endeavour to bring 
the mind under control of his higher conscious self. This is 
indeed the foremost challenge that a yogî faces.
In some western philosophical systems the mind is 
conceived of as the self, but this does not hold true in 
yoga. In yoga, the mind is called ‘the sense within’. The 
senses of the body like sight, sound, touch, smell and taste 
are engaged with external objects and the mind acts as the 
faculty that ultimately makes sense of sensual experiences 
– the sense within. But in yoga the self is conceived of as 
a transcendental substance that exists independent of the 
mind and body. Therefore, according to the knowledge of 
yoga, the self survives the death of the body and mind. It is 
something completely different.
There are many external practices within the yoga system 
such as fasting and living in a secluded place that help to 
Chapter 6167
control the mind. But owing to the nature of the mind 
being like the wind, these external methods frequently fall 
short of the mark. However, in the bhakti-yoga  system it is 
recommended to control the mind by mantra . The word 
mantra  originates from two Sanskrit words – mana  (the 
mind) and tråyate  (to control). By engaging the mind in 
the process of hearing and chanting mantras –  and espe -
cially the mahå-mantra , the great mantra  for delivering the 
mind – the wandering mind becomes steady in the self.
The mahå-mantra  is a direct sound representation of 
the Absolute Truth, Çrî K®ß√a. As such, the mahå-mantra  
is both all-powerful and all-attractive. The power of the 
mahå-mantra  removes the ignorance that covers the real 
identity of the living being and the all-attractive nature 
of the mahå-mantra  fills the heart of the chanter with 
inconceivable ånanda , supreme spiritual bliss. Chanting of 
the mahå-mantra  to control and steady the mind has been 
highly recommended for these reasons."

There are five primary subject matters explained in 
Bhagavad-gîtå,  namely åtmå (individual consciousness), 
prak®ti  (material nature), karma  (action), kåla (time) and 
ˆçvara (the Supreme Controller). The culmination of 
knowledge is to understand Çrî K®ß√a as the underlying 
principle of everything. Yet some commentators on Bhaga -
vad-gîtå  have tried to explain the Gîtå minus K®ß√a. That is 
to say, they have said such things as, “K®ß√a was a tempo -
rary manifestation of the Supreme Brahman,” “K®ß√a has 
no eternal existence as a person” or that when K®ß√a says 
things like, “One attains My abode,” K®ß√a actually means 
that one attains something else of an impersonal nature. 
However, true masters of yoga and scholars of Vedic liter -
ature reject all these ideas.
Bhagavad-gîtå , although surely mystical in that it delin -
eates in great detail the Absolute Truth and how to attain 
that Truth, is not an allegorical or speculative treatise on 
the subject of perfection. Bhagavad-gîtå  is to be taken lit -
erally as a conversation between Çrî K®ß√a and His dear 
friend and devotee, Arjuna. Therein lies the open secret to 
Chapter 6171
understanding Bhagavad-gîtå . K®ß√a says what He means 
and means what He says – therefore an abstract commen -
tary on Bhagavad-gîtå  is not necessary. 
That Çrî K®ß√a is everywhere, in all things and within 
the hearts of all living beings is confirmed by the above 
verses. K®ß√a says that He is in all living beings as the Par -
amåtmå and all living beings are in Him as His parts and 
parcels. K®ß√a is in all things and all things are in K®ß√a. 
One who endeavours to see in this way becomes enlight -
ened – indeed such a vision is enlightenment.
Arjuna, being a self-realised yogî and an eternal associ -
ate of K®ß√a, does not argue with K®ß√a over such conclu -
sions. However, Arjuna does object to the rigours of yoga 
required to attain such perfection. Arjuna was a family man 
with many responsibilities, so how was he to practice yoga? 
Arjuna pleads his case in favour of day to day people in 
that the yoga system of rigorous mind control described so 
far by K®ß√a is too difficult. It is simply impractical.
K®ß√a’s assurance to Arjuna is that if one perseveres 
then one will certainly be successful. But understanding 
Arjuna’s point, K®ß√a will indeed bring the attainment 
of the Absolute Truth into the reach of everyone as the 
Bhagavad-gîtå  discourse continues."

Arjuna’s questions in verses 37 and 38 are very critical for 
our understanding. Arjuna wants to know what happens to 
one who practices yoga for sometime, but for some reason or 
another, does not become completely self-realised and gives 
up the body at death without having attained perfection. 
What is the destination of such a person in the next life?
The first thing to note here is that Arjuna is aware or 
completely convinced that this one life is not the all-in-all. 
As Çrî K®ß√a has said previously, we have had many lives 
in the past and we will have many in the future. Therefore 
Arjuna wants to know of his fate or that of anyone who 
practices yoga but does not reach perfection. What will be 
the fate of such a person in the next life?
K®ß√a’s reply is that of the all-knowing, omniscient 
Supreme Being. K®ß√a says that for the yogî there is never 
any loss. If one does not achieve perfection in this life 
then in the next life one will be born in favourable cir -
cumstances and begin the process anew. In the next life, 
one will again become attracted to the practice of yoga 
and continue on the path. Even if it takes many lifetimes, 
Bhagavad-gitathe yogî, with perseverance and determination, attains the 
supreme destination. Therefore, K®ß√a tells Arjuna, in all 
circumstances, be a yogî.

Bhagavad-gitaAnuv®tti
This chapter of Bhagavad-gîtå  is entitled Jñåna-Vijñåna 
Yoga. Jñåna  means knowledge of self as distinguished 
from non-self, or knowledge that the self is not the body. 
Vijñåna  means realised knowledge or realisation of one’s 
intrinsic relationship with K®ß√a. Çrîmad Bhågavatam  also 
mentions jñåna  and vijñåna  as follows:
jñånaµ parama guhyaµ me yad vijñåna-samanvitam
sa-rahasyaµ tad a∫gaµ ca g®hå√a gaditaµ mayå
Knowledge ( jñåna ) about K®ß√a as described in the 
Vedic literatures is very confidential, and it has to 
be realised ( vijñåna ) in conjunction with the secrets 
of devotion. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam  2.9.31)
When we speak of knowledge, modern man immedi -
ately thinks of scientific knowledge which he deems to 
be most perfect. However, jñåna  in Bhagavad-gîtå  refers 
to that knowledge of the self as distinguished from the 
knowledge of matter or scientific knowledge. Knowledge 
of matter is called aparå-vidyå  and it is quite distinct 
from the knowledge of the self in that it never leads to 
self-realisation.
Since the beginning of the Rationalist movement, some 
five centuries ago, science has completely rejected the idea 
of consciousness as independent of matter. Many scientific 
theories have been presented to explain the origin of the 
universe and the origin of life such as the ‘Big Bang’ and 
Darwinian Evolution, but these explanations remain mere 
theories, lacking conclusive evidence.
Chapter 7181
For centuries, scientific and theistic communities have 
been at odds with each other, but recently it appears that 
the two may finally be drawing closer. Leading persons in 
the scientific community are willing to accept conscious -
ness as a scientific fact. Indeed, biologist and stem-cell 
therapist, Dr. Robert Lanza has of late rocked the scien -
tific world with his book, Biocentrism – How Life Creates 
the Universe , in which he postulates that consciousness has 
evolved matter and not that matter has evolved conscious -
ness. If this current trend continues then indeed science 
may very well be on the path of jñåna .
The understanding of consciousness being the origin of 
matter has taken a long time to manifest. But as K®ß√a says in 
verse 3, those who endeavour for perfection are very rare, and 
rarer still are those who actually understand K®ß√a. To this 
end, all learned and educated people in the world should take 
lessons from Bhagavad-gîtå."

Anuv®tti
The basic material elements that comprise the universe 
have been mentioned here. Earth ( bhümi ), water ( åpa), fire 
(anala ) and air ( våyu) are, for the most part, easy to com -
prehend – whereas khaµ , the invisible element, is rather 
more difficult. Khaµ  is defined as accommodating space 
for existence. For a long time, modern science has rejected 
the Bhagavad-gîtå’s  concept of space as an element. How -
ever, once again the scientific community finds itself 
facing serious problems wherein an elusive element must 
be present in the universe in order for them to explain how 
the universe works. This element, physicists say, may com -
prise up to 80% or more of the universe, but is unknown 
to them and is thus far undetectable. They have called this 
‘Dark Matter’.
Chapter 7183
The first person to provide evidence and infer the 
existence of the phenomenon of Dark Matter was the 
Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky, of the California Insti -
tute of Technology in 1933. Zwicky applied the viral 
theorem to the Coma cluster of galaxies and obtained evi -
dence of unseen mass. Zwicky estimated the cluster’s total 
mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and 
compared that estimate to one based on the number of 
galaxies and total brightness of the cluster. He found that 
there was about four-hundred times more estimated mass 
than was visually observable. The gravity of the visible 
galaxies in the cluster would be far too small for such fast 
orbits, so something extra was required. This is known as 
the ‘Missing Mass Problem’. Based on these conclusions, 
Zwicky inferred that there must be some non-visible form 
of matter that would provide enough of the mass and 
gravity to hold the cluster together. That was the begin -
ning of the search for Dark Matter.
Seventy-eight years later, science is still looking for 
Dark Matter. They know it is literally everywhere, but it 
escapes detection and thus they are unable to observe it. 
Millions in taxpayers’ money is spent every year by western 
scientists in the search for Dark Matter. Nothing has yet 
been discovered.
However, the Çrîmad Bhågavatam  identifies a material 
element that among its other qualities is, for the most part, 
elusive. It is all-pervading, but simultaneously it is unde -
tectable. That element according to Bhågavatam  is called 
nabhas , or as mentioned here in Bhagavad-gîtå, khaµ.
The activities, qualities and characteristics of the khaµ  
element can be observed as accommodating space/room 
Bhagavad-gitafor existence. Space itself, both internal and external, is the 
element khaµ . This then, if taken notice of by physicists, 
may very well fit nicely into the ‘Missing Mass Problem’. 
Khaµ , being a material element, could theoretically be 
assigned a numerical code – then they might find what 
they are looking for.
In the Vedic way of thinking, a physical element is 
secondary to its qualities – when the qualities of a par -
ticular thing are understood, it is as good as or better than 
having the gross object at hand. In that sense, modern 
science has already discovered Dark Matter, because they 
have understood something of its qualities – they just hav -
en’t realised it yet. In the Çrîmad  Bhågavatam  we find the 
following verse:
bhütånåµ chidra-dåt®tvaµ bahir antaram eva ca
prå√endriyåtma-dhiß√yatvaµ nabhaso v®tti-lakßa√am
The activities and characteristics of nabhas  can be 
observed as accommodation for external and inter -
nal existences of all living beings, namely the field 
of activities of the vital air, the senses and the mind. 
(Çrîmad Bhågavatam 3.26.34)
This verse is the potential basis for great scientific 
research work. It explains how subtle forms are generated 
from nabhas , what their characteristics and actions are, 
and how the tangible elements, namely air, fire, water and 
earth, are manifested from the subtle form.
Bhågavatam  does not simply list the basic material ele -
ments, but explains quite scientifically how those elements 
evolve from the most subtle plane of existence up to the 
Chapter 7185
divisions of the universe – this is quite elaborate and sci -
entific indeed. Yet for science to take full advantage of this 
understanding of matter and to discover how the universe 
came into being, they will have to do more than just add 
khaµ to their table of elements – they will have to add 
aha∫kåra  (false ego), mana  (the mind) and buddhi  (intel -
ligence). For indeed, Bhagavad-gîtå  lists these as material 
elements. Furthermore, these elements, aha∫kåra, mana  
and buddhi  are categorised as even more subtle than khaµ , 
because they are closer in character to consciousness ( åtmå).
Beyond the gross and subtle material elements being 
added to the scientific table, Bhagavad-gîtå  says that a 
complete understanding of existence and reality is not 
possible without adding two transcendental, anti-material 
concepts – namely åtmå and Paramåtmå (consciousness 
and Super Consciousness). This, it seems, science strug -
gles with even more than Dark Matter. We have dubbed 
these ‘Light Matter’.
Mind and intelligence should not be confused with the 
self or åtmå. Mind and intelligence have not arisen out of 
matter as some philosophers or scientists have suggested. 
Last in the list is aha∫kåra  or false ego. All these are mate -
rial elements which manifest from the aparå-prak®ti  or the 
inferior energy of K®ß√a. These gross and subtle elements 
make up the material body and cover the self within.
Those conditioned by material elements consider the 
body as the self. But K®ß√a says that there is another energy 
of His – a superior energy, which is a conscious potency 
and consists of all living beings. 
Bhagavad-gîtå  clearly explains both the gross and subtle 
material elements as well as consciousness and Super Con -
Bhagavad-gitasciousness. Any theory that does not include all of these 
elements is surely inadequate."

Anuv®tti
Since the most ancient times we find the same funda -
mental questions in the search for knowledge and meaning 
– Who are we? Where did we come from? Why are we 
here? How should we conduct ourselves? Is there life after 
death? These were questions in the minds of our ancestors 
and we still ask the same questions today. The search for 
answers to these questions leads an intelligent person to 
conclude that consciousness is superior to matter and that 
there must be one absolute source from which everything 
in the universe and beyond emanates.
Here Çrî K®ß√a says that He is the singular cause of 
everything and that nothing is superior to Him. He is 
the sum total of the universe and of all living creatures, 
but He Himself remains separate from everything as the 
Supreme Individual.
Throughout the yoga systems we find that the chant -
ing of mantras  is highly recommended and possibly no 
mantra  is chanted more than oµ, or oµkåra . This oµkåra  is 
described as the supreme combination of letters ( a, u and 
µ) and is thus the primary Vedic mantra . Here Çrî K®ß√a 
Chapter 7189
says that He is the oµ found in Vedic mantras  and as such, 
it is K®ß√a that is to be meditated on while chanting oµ. In 
support of this the ‰g Veda  states as follows:
oµ ity etad brahma√o nediß†aµ 
nåma yasmåd uccåryamåna
eva saµsåra-bhayåt tårayati 
tasmåd-ucyate tåra iti
oµ åsya jånanto nåma cid-viviktan mahaste viß√o
sumatiµ bhajåmahe oµ tat sat
tato ‘bhüt triv®d-oµkåro yo ‘vyakta prabhava˙ svarå†
yat tal-li∫gaµ bhagavato brahma√a˙ paramåtmana˙
One who chants oµ, which is the closest form of 
Brahman, approaches Brahman. This liberates one 
from the fear of the material world; therefore, it is 
known as tåraka-brahman . O Viß√u/K®ß√a, Your 
self-manifested name, oµ, is the eternal form of 
cognisance. Even if my knowledge about the glo -
ries of reciting this name is incomplete, still, by the 
practice of reciting this name, I will achieve perfect 
knowledge. He who has unmanifested potencies and 
is fully independent manifests the vibration oµkåra , 
which indicates Himself. Brahman, Paramåtmå and 
Bhagavån are the three forms He manifests. ( Dh®ta 
‰g Veda 1.156.3)
Now the question may arise that if oµ is non-differ -
ent from Çrî K®ß√a, what then is the necessity to chant 
the mahå-mantra ? Great åcåryas  such as Jîva Gosvåmî, 
Viçvanåtha Cakravartî, Bhaktivinoda, Sarasvatî ˇhåkura, 
Svåmî B.R. Çrîdhara, Bhaktivedånta Svåmî Prabhupåda and 
Bhagavad-gitaothers are all in agreement that oµ helps us up to the stage 
of liberation from material bondage. But the benefits of 
chanting the mahå-mantra  continue even after liberation, 
helping us to develop spontaneous affection for K®ß√a and 
thus cultivate our eternal relationship with Him.
In the ontology of mantras  it is said that oµ ema -
nates from the flute of Çrî K®ß√a; it then manifests as 
gåyatrî-mantra , then as the Vedas , Vedånta and Çrîmad 
Bhågavatam.  The last verse of Bhågavatam  recommends the 
chanting of the mahå-mantra.
nåma-sa∫kîrtanaµ yasya sarva-påpa-pra√åçanam
pra√åmo du˙kha-çamanas taµ namåmi hariµ param
The chanting of the mahå-mantra  can relieve us from 
all undesirable habits, all filthy characteristics and 
all miseries. Chant the mahå-mantra ! Nothing else 
is necessary. Take this! Chant the mahå-mantra  and 
begin your real life in this dark age of Kali-yuga with 
the most broad and wide theistic conception. Let 
us all bow down to Çrî K®ß√a. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam 
12.13.23)
One may chant oµ and certainly everyone should chant 
the mahå-mantra . Those who do this under the guidance 
of the spiritual master will certainly taste the fruits of 
self-realisation."

Anuv®tti
Çrî K®ß√a speaks here about His måyå  potency, also 
known as mahå-måyå,  to distinguish it from His internal 
potency known as yoga-måyå . Mahå-måyå  is the potency 
of material energy and the modes of nature that condi -
tion all living beings in material existence, binding them 
to saµsåra . These three modes of material nature will be 
discussed at length in Chapter 14 of Bhagavad-gîtå.
K®ß√a says that to escape the modes of material nature 
is very difficult for the conditioned living being, but one 
who takes shelter of K®ß√a in bhakti-yoga  can easily cross 
beyond them. This is recommended as follows:
akåma˙ sarva-kåmo vå mokßa-kåma udåra-dhî˙  
tîvre√a bhakti-yogena yajeta purußaµ param
Chapter 7193
Whether one is without desire or full of desire or 
aspires for liberation – one should take shelter of 
the Supreme Person through bhakti-yoga . (Çrîmad 
Bhågavatam 2.3.10).
K®ß√a further explains that pious persons (the dis -
tressed, the inquisitive, those seeking wealth and those 
desiring self-realisation) take shelter of Him, but of these 
K®ß√a says that those in search of knowledge and self-real -
isation are superior.
After taking shelter of Çrî K®ß√a for wealth, out of curi -
osity or out of distress, it is often seen that such persons 
again resume their normal course of material activities. 
Those who come to K®ß√a for knowledge and self-realisa -
tion truly become liberated from material desires and enter 
into a plane of eternal bliss. Ultimately they attain K®ß√a’s 
Supreme Abode, never to return to the world of birth and 
death as will be explained in Chapter 15. Therefore, the 
seekers of self-realisation who take shelter of K®ß√a and 
absorb all their thoughts and deeds in K®ß√a are considered 
the best among virtuous persons."

Surrender to Çrî K®ß√a may not be achieved in one 
lifetime. In fact K®ß√a says that after many lifetimes of 
acquiring knowledge one ultimately surrenders unto Him 
knowing Våsudeva (K®ß√a) to be the source of all that be. 
Indeed such persons are very rare – sa mahåtmå sudurlabha˙ .
Mahåtmå  literally means a great personality or devotee 
of K®ß√a, but one does not become a mahåtmå  simply by 
‘rubber stamping’. There are required qualities and only 
those who manifest such qualities should be respected 
as a mahåtmå . These qualities are mentioned in Caitan -
ya-caritåm®ta as follows: 
k®pålu, ak®ta-droha, satya-såra sama
nidoßa, vadånya, m®du, çuci, akiñcana
sarvopakåraka, çånta, k®ß√aika-çara√a
akåma, anîha, sthira, vijita-ßa∂-gu√a
mita-bhuk, apramatta, månada, amånî
gambhîra, karu√a, maitra, kavi, dakßa, maunî
Devotees of Çrî K®ß√a are always merciful, humble, 
truthful, and equal to all, faultless, magnanimous, 
mild and clean. They are without material posses -
sions, and they perform welfare work for everyone. 
They are peaceful, surrendered to K®ß√a and without 
desire. They are indifferent to material acquisitions 
Bhagavad-gitaand are fixed in devotion to K®ß√a. They completely 
control the six bad qualities – lust, anger, greed and 
so forth. They eat only as much as required, and 
they are not intoxicated with false ego. They are 
respectful, grave, compassionate and without false 
prestige. They are friendly, poetic, expert and silent. 
(Caitanya-caritåm®ta, Madhya-lîlå , 22. 78-80)
The popularity of the bhakti  movement in contempo -
rary times has also come to include the worship of many 
demigods and demigoddesses such as Çiva, Ga√eça, Sar -
asvatî, Lakßmî etc. However, according to Bhagavad-gîtå , 
the worship of various demigods is not on the same level 
as worshipping K®ß√a and thus does not help one advance 
in self-realisation. Bhakti-yoga  is solely meant for K®ß√a. 
Bhakti  is the reciprocal exchange between K®ß√a and His 
devotees and thus bhakti  is incompatible with the worship 
of the demigods.
It is not that the demigods are ‘false gods,’ but they 
simply cannot free one from material bondage. K®ß√a 
knows what is necessary for the ultimate good of all living 
creatures and therefore He says that worship of demigods 
is less intelligent.
It can also be said that those who worship the demi -
gods worship K®ß√a indirectly, because the demigods are 
the representatives of K®ß√a for the management of uni -
versal affairs. In that way the worship of demigods is also 
the worship of K®ß√a, save and except for the fruits of 
liberation. Only K®ß√a is known as mukti-pada , the giver 
of liberation, or Mukunda. Speaking in Padma Purå√a , 
Çiva says:
Chapter 7197
mukti-pradåtå sarveßåµ viß√ur eva na saµçaya˙
Undoubtedly, Viß√u (K®ß√a) is the only deliverer of 
liberation for all. ( Padma Purå√a  6.253.176)
When surrender to K®ß√a is the only shelter from the 
cycle of birth and death, then it stands to reason that one 
should take shelter of K®ß√a and forego the worship of 
various demigods."

Herein Çrî K®ß√a states His position quite unequivo -
cally. He is eternal, without birth, supreme and imperish -
Bhagavad-gitaable. To this He adds that those who are foolish ( mü∂ha ), 
consider His appearance in this world to be a temporary 
appearance of the impersonal Brahman in material form. 
Such misguided philosophers consider that K®ß√a’s body is 
material and that K®ß√a, like other living beings, is a man -
ifestation from the brahma-jyoti . In Chapter 14 of Bhaga -
vad-gîtå , K®ß√a will explain that He is the very source of 
the brahma-jyoti and that all living beings emanate from 
Him. K®ß√a does not manifest or reveal Himself to every -
one – particularly to those who are envious or jealous of 
Him. To the envious K®ß√a is covered by His own spiritual 
potency, y oga-måyå  and at the same time the envious are 
covered by mahå-måyå in the cycle of birth and death."

For the serious student of yoga and, for that matter, 
anyone desiring the perfection of life, Arjuna asks Çrî 
K®ß√a, his dearest friend and well-wisher, a series of very 
important questions. Vedånta-sütra , one of the most schol -
arly literatures ever written on the thesis of transcendence, 
begins with the statement, oµ athåto brahma-jijñåså  – 
‘Now in this human form of life, one should inquire into 
Brahman’. The human form of life is actually meant for 
inquiry into such matters as Arjuna has put forward, and 
the Supreme Master of yoga, Çrî K®ß√a, will now answer 
Bhagavad-gitathem most concisely. The purpose of the human form of 
life is also explained in Çrîmad Bhågavatam  as follows:
kåmasya nendriya-prîtir låbho jîveta yåvatå
jîvasya tattva-jijñåså nårtho yaç ceha karmabhi˙
Life’s desires should never be aimed towards gratify -
ing the senses. One should desire a healthy life only 
because human life is meant for inquiry about the 
Absolute Truth. Nothing else should be the goal of 
one’s activities. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam  1.2.10)"

Bhagavad-gitaAnuv®tti
Çrî K®ß√a’s answers to Arjuna are to the point and if one 
accepts K®ß√a as the ultimate authority in yoga, as indeed 
He is, then one quickly attains the most valuable knowl -
edge. To acquire perfect knowledge by speculation or by 
the process of trial and error simply wastes valuable time. 
In fact, so much time is wasted in speculation and exper -
imentation that even after centuries such processes have 
failed to deliver perfect knowledge of the meaning of life. 
Everyone is dying, and for the most part dying without 
answers to life’s most basic questions. However, since time 
immemorial, Çrî K®ß√a has had the answers and they are 
presented here in Bhagavad-gîtå.
K®ß√a says that all living beings are Brahman – part and 
parcel of the spiritual energy of the Absolute Truth – eter -
nal, individual, imperishable and immutable. However, in 
this material world death of the body comes to everyone. 
There are no exceptions. But for those whose mind and 
intelligence are fixed on K®ß√a, they do not take birth 
again in the material world, but attain K®ß√a’s own divine 
nature. K®ß√a is by nature sac-cid-ånanda  – eternal, com -
plete in knowledge and full of bliss. Remembering K®ß√a 
at the time of death, one attains that nature and is imme -
diately transferred to the abode of K®ß√a, far beyond the 
material sky and the planets of birth and death. As K®ß√a 
will explain in Chapter 15, one who attains His Supreme 
Abode does not return to this material world.
When we speak of saµsåra , we are indeed talking about 
reincarnation. Although reincarnation is becoming a pop -
ular belief in many communities, it is for the most part 
misunderstood. To many, reincarnation means being born 
Chapter 8207
as a human being life after life, but this is not a fact. The 
human form of life is only rarely achieved. It is not some -
thing that comes in rapid succession. Above and below the 
human species there are hundreds and thousands of other 
life forms. According to one’s activities performed in this 
life and one’s final consciousness and state of mind at the 
time of death, one‘s next birth is determined.
In the species below the human being, namely animal, 
aquatic, insect and plant life, there is great ignorance and 
suffering. Above the human plane there are higher planets 
full of celestial beings and celestial pleasures. Yet higher or 
lower, all stations of life in the material world are tempo -
rary. There is no place of eternal damnation and no place 
of eternal happiness in the material universe. Nothing 
in this world is everlasting. Only the abode of K®ß√a is 
beyond the dualities of pleasure and suffering. 
K®ß√a says above in verse 5, anta-kåle ca måm eva 
smaran muktvå kalevaram  – one who remembers Him at 
the time of death attains His transcendental nature. To 
remember K®ß√a at the end of life is indeed perfection, and 
to forget Him is the greatest aberration. The Viß√u-dhar -
mottara Purå√a  states:
så hånis tan mahac-chidraµ sa moha˙ sa ca vibhrama˙
yan muhürtaµ kßa√aµ våpi våsudevo na cintayet
If even for a moment remembrance of K®ß√a is 
missed, that is the greatest loss, the greatest illu -
sion and the greatest anomaly. ( Viß√u-dharmottara 
Purå√a 1.16)
Bhagavad-gitaHowever, it is our experience of the world that death 
is often accompanied by great pain, confusion and bewil -
derment of memory. Therefore, it would seem that to 
remember K®ß√a at the time of death is no easy task. Death 
may come swiftly at any time, without a moments notice 
or even during sleep, thus impeding one’s remembrance of 
K®ß√a. In this regard Kulaçekhara Ålvår writes in Mukun -
da-målå Stotram  as follows:
k®ß√a tvadîya-pada-pa∫kaja-pañjaråntam
adyaiva me viçatu månasa-råja-haµsa˙
prå√a-prayå√a-samaye kapha-våta-pittai˙
ka√†håvarodhana-vidhau smara√aµ kutas te
O K®ß√a, please help me die quickly so the swan 
of my mind may become encircled by the stem of 
Your lotus feet. Otherwise at the time of my final 
breath, when my throat is choked up, how will it be 
possible for me to think of You? ( Mukunda-målå 
Stotram 33)
For the bhakti-yogî  K®ß√a takes all his many endeavours, 
practices and services into consideration. Even if the bhak-
ti-yogî  is unable to remember K®ß√a at the time of death, 
K®ß√a will certainly remember him. Çrî K®ß√a is never for -
getful under any circumstance and thus He swiftly delivers 
His devotee from the clutches of death. K®ß√a Himself 
confirms this in the Varåha Purå√a  as follows:
yadi vitådi-doße√a mad bhakto måµ ca na smaret
ahaµ smaråmi mad bhakta˙ nayåmi paramåµ gatim
Chapter 8209
If My devotee is unable to remember Me at the time 
of death because of the great disturbances felt within 
the body, at that time I shall remember My devotee 
and take him to the spiritual world."

Anuv®tti
Yoga and meditation are described herein. However, 
they are not impersonal or self-centred processes. Medita -
tion is to be performed on the Absolute Truth, Çrî K®ß√a – 
not on abstract ideas that we ourselves are the sum total of 
reality, that we are all-knowing or that we are the supreme 
controller etc. Such processes are not meditation, but 
self-deception and never lead to liberation or eternal bliss.
In verse 10, Çrî K®ß√a says that in yogic meditations 
(aß†å√ga  and ku√∂alinî-yoga ) one should draw one’s life-
airs to the area of the eyebrows. This indicates the location 
of the åjñå-cakra . There are seven cakras  located in the 
body that are the primary seats of human consciousness. 
Consciousness pervades the entire body, but is said to 
be centred in one of the seven cakras  – mülådhåra-cakra  
(located at the base of the genital), svådhiß†håna-cakra  
(located at the base of the spinal cord), ma√ipüra-cakra  
(located in the navel area), anåhata-cakra  (located in the 
heart), viçuddha-cakra  (located in the throat), åjñå-cakra  
(located in between the eyebrows) and the sahasråra-cakra  
(located at the top of the head).
Chapter 8211
When consciousness is situated in the lower three cakras  
one is found to be preoccupied with the animal tendencies 
of eating, sleeping, mating and defending. When con -
sciousness is situated in the upper cakras  there is progress 
in the finer sentiments of spiritual culture and ultimately 
liberation. Consciousness is raised in meditation from one 
cakra  to another through the subtle passage in the body 
known as the sußum√å-nå∂î .
K®ß√a says that the yogî should bring his consciousness 
to be seated in the åjñå-cakra , sometimes known as the 
‘third eye’. Here the yogî makes his or her final preparation 
and at last raises the consciousness through the sußum√å-
nå∂î to the sahasråra-cakra  and from there the yogî quits the 
material body. If the aß†å∫ga-yogî  or ku√∂alinî-yogî  makes 
Çrî K®ß√a the object of his meditation while concentrating 
on the åjñå-cakra , then after passing the sahasråra-cakra , 
the yogî achieves K®ß√a’s Supreme Abode. However, if the 
said yogî does not make Çrî K®ß√a the object of his medita -
tion, then he may enter the brahma-jyoti  for sometime, but 
eventually he returns to this material world.
The aforementioned processes of yoga take superhu -
man endeavour and for the most part are not possible for 
the average person to achieve in this age. Aß†å∫ga-yoga  
and ku√∂alinî-yoga  must be practiced in absolute seclu -
sion from society, observing complete celibacy and fasting 
for long periods. In ancient times such yogîs went to the 
mountain caves of the Himålayas or to the deserts. Today’s 
yogîs in modern yoga studios and societies are unable to 
raise their consciousness through the cakras  to the sahas-
råra-cakra  because they lack the solitude and severe deter -
mination required. Therefore, Bhagavad-gîtå  conclusively 
Bhagavad-gitarecommends the process of bhakti-yoga  that can be prac -
ticed by everyone, everywhere, by fixing the mind on Çrî 
K®ß√a and thus attaining perfection.
One may question that since Çrî K®ß√a is speaking here 
in the third person that He is not referring to Himself as 
the object of meditation and therefore it does not mean 
that we should meditate on K®ß√a. However, according to 
Svåmî B. R. Çrîdhara Mahåråja, a great åcårya  of bhakti-yoga , 
when K®ß√a speaks in the third person, He is referring to 
the object of meditation as His expansion as Paramåtmå 
(Super Consciousness). As already explained in the Second 
Chapter, Çrî K®ß√a manifests Himself as the Paramåtmå, 
present in the hearts of all living beings. Therefore, medi -
tation on the Paramåtmå means meditation on K®ß√a.
Those who cannot comprehend the Absolute Truth 
as personal, due to anarthas  (misgivings of the heart), can 
meditate on K®ß√a’s impersonal aspect as Brahman. But 
this process is tedious and the results are limited since even 
the Brahman-realised yogî must once again return to the 
world of birth and death."

Anuv®tti
Modern systems of yoga focus more or less on achiev -
ing a healthy condition for the body, but this is actually 
not the aim of yoga. The process of yoga is intended for 
one goal and one goal alone – to transcend the world 
of birth and death. There is, of course, more than one 
system of yoga,  but all schools of yoga aim at a singular 
goal – liberation.
As already explained in previous commentaries, the 
mantra  oµ elevates one to the stage of liberation. However, 
it should be noted here that the divisions of yoga,  such as 
sense-control and celibacy, must also be in place before 
the chanting of mantras  can be effective. Mantras  purify 
the mind and heart of material contamination which arises 
from sense enjoyment. If one endeavours for purification, 
but at the same time does not control the senses, then it is 
tantamount to starting a fire while simultaneously pouring 
water on it. Sense-control is therefore essential for those 
attempting to practice all forms of yoga.

The topmost planet in the material universe is known as 
Satya-loka, the abode of Brahmå. Life on that planet is very 
long – one day in Satya-loka is equal to 4,260,000,000 
years on planet Earth. Nonetheless death occurs there also. 
Nowhere in the material universe is free from death.
At the end of each of Brahmå’s days there is a partial 
annihilation in the universe and a total annihilation of the 
universe at the end of Brahmå’s life. The partial annihila -
tions are called pralaya  and the final annihilation is called 
mahå -pralaya . Everything in the universe has a beginning 
and an end. All things come into being and eventually 
all things are destroyed. Creation, duration and annihila -
tion are the three basic phases of the universe, yet Bhaga -
vad-gîtå  does not subscribe to an apocalyptic world view 
or an ‘end times’ scenario in which we will all be judged.
The predominating Deities of creation, duration and 
annihilation are the three gu√åvatåras , Brahmå, Mahå-
Viß√u and Çiva respectively. Brahmå manifests the second -
ary creation, Mahå-Viß√u maintains the creation and Çiva, 
by producing a sound vibration from his ∂amaru  drum, 
brings about the annihilation. These gu√åvatåras  are por -
tions of the plenary expansions of K®ß√a, the avatårî , or 
origin of all avatåras . During the periods of annihilation, 
both partial and complete, the living beings rest in a state 
Bhagavad-gitaof slumber within the body of Mahå-Viß√u and are again 
manifest at the arrival of Brahmå’s day. This is repeated 
over and over again on a cosmic timescale until Brahmå 
reaches the end of his life, at which point the entire universe 
is again wound up in the body of Mahå-Viß√u. Everything 
necessary for the manifestation of the material universe, 
and indeed billions and trillions of universes, is provided 
by Mahå-Viß√u in the form of the mahat-tattva  (the aggre -
gate of material elements), and at the time of annihilation 
that energy is again absorbed into Mahå-Viß√u.
Energy is neither created or destroyed as it exists 
always as K®ß√a’s aparå-prak®ti,  inferior material energy. 
That energy is endlessly mutable, manifest and unman -
ifest, but ultimately it is never destroyed. K®ß√a and all 
His energies are eternal.
Once again, the same point is being reiterated by 
K®ß√a, that His Supreme Abode is beyond material 
nature, eternally manifest, beyond birth and death and 
once going there one does not return to saµsåra . That 
Supreme Abode of K®ß√a is Goloka V®ndåvana, and it is 
attainable only through the process of bhakti-yoga . This 
Supreme Abode is mentioned in B®had-bhågavatåm®ta  as 
follows:
goloka-nåmopari sarva-sîma-go 
vaiku√†hato deça-viçeßa-çekhara˙

the footsteps of the people of Vraja who have pure 
love for K®ß√a. ( B®had-bhågavatåm®ta 2.5.78-79)"

Chapter 8221
 Knowing this, a yogî surpasses all kinds of pious results 
that are achieved through study of the Vedas , by offering 
oblations in sacrifice, by penances and by philanthropy. 
That yogî reaches the eternal abode. 
Anuv®tti
To attain higher planets within the material universe 
one must study the Vedas , offer sacrifice, perform pen -
ances and acts of charity. One who has performed these 
activities is reborn on a higher planet and lives a long life, 
enjoying great luxury for tens of thousands of years.
However, the bhakti-yogî  has no desire to enjoy in 
higher planets. He easily achieves all the benefits of sacri -
fice, penance etc. simply by surrendering to Çrî K®ß√a. The 
bhakti-yogî  does not have to choose an auspicious moment 
to leave the material body because he is under the shelter of 
K®ß√a. Everything is auspiciously ordained for those who 
have surrendered to K®ß√a, enabling them to reach K®ß√a’s 
eternal abode.
But the yogî who is not in bhakti-yoga  does not achieve 
the Supreme Abode of K®ß√a nor does he easily ascend to 
higher planets at the time of death. Factually speaking, the 
yogî has to choose the time of his death, so as to pass from 
the body at the most opportune time. He must choose 
wisely, otherwise he is born again on this Earth. Needless 
to say, this is a near impossibility – especially for ordinary 
people. Therefore, it is the yogî in bhakti-yoga that is most 
assured of success.

path of dharma  can never attain Me and are forced to be

Anuv®tti
Now Çrî K®ß√a will emphasise to Arjuna what He con -
siders to be the greatest secret, or guhya,  of the yoga system, 
so that any remaining doubt that Arjuna may still harbour 
might be dispelled. This has already been mentioned in 
previous chapters, but now K®ß√a will make it definitive. 
Çrî K®ß√a is the Absolute Truth, the Cause of creation, 
the origin of all living beings, the Controller, the object of 
knowledge, the mantra  oµ and so forth. One who knows 
this in his heart of hearts and lives solely by such a creed 
will surely attain K®ß√a. This is the positive incentive. The 
negative incentive is also explained by K®ß√a that those 
who are not fixed in Him will be reborn in the cycle of 
birth and death.
In verse 3 K®ß√a uses the word açraddadhånå˙.  Çrad-
dhå means ‘faith’ and açraddhå means ‘without faith’. This 
describes those who do not have the resolute determina -
tion to perform bhakti-yoga . Of such persons K®ß√a says 
that they will continue in the cycle of saµsåra . That is 
not to say that they are damned to some eternal hell, but 
simply put, they cannot attain the platform of liberation.
First it is important to understand that çraddhå  is not 
to be confused with the belief or mundane faith that is 
usually associated with a particular religion such as Juda -
ism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism. Christian 
faith, Muslim faith, Hindu faith etc. implies a belief in 
a particular set of moral ideals, myths, superstitions and 
dogmas, but çraddhå  is something entirely different.
Chapter 9227
Çrat dadhåti iti çraddhå˙  – ‘That which leads to truth 
and self-realisation is known as çraddhå .’ Çraddhå  is devel -
oped by association with saintly persons who are self-real -
ised and free from the contamination of material nature. In 
such association the conviction develops that by surrender 
and taking shelter of K®ß√a all other purposes are served. 
Without such çraddhå  and fixed determination, one cannot 
follow the path of bhakti-yoga ."

Everyone acts in the material world and everyone is 
held responsible for their actions by the laws of material 
nature or the laws of karma . Newton’s Third Law of Phys -
ics states that for every action there is an equal and oppo -
site reaction. At a glance this sounds like a good definition 
of karma,  but karma  is much more complicated than that. 
The saying, ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’ 
also does not accurately define the laws of action and reac -
tion. Karma  is far more intricate and complicated than a 
simple one on one analogy can provide. Suffice to say that 
when one performs an action he is held responsible and 
thus liable for the reaction, whatever that may be. Material 
nature may therefore be considered superior to the energy 
of the living beings, in that the living beings have no con -
trol over material nature. People are expert in exploiting 
Bhagavad-gitanature, yet they cannot control the adverse reactions that 
result from it.  Çrî K®ß√a, on the other hand, does not incur 
karma  or a reaction when He acts because material nature 
is always under His control – îçvara˙ parama˙ k®ß√a˙ ."

Those that deride the message of Bhagavad-gîtå are 
referred to as mü∂hå  or having a foolish mentality. Intel -
ligent persons, when confronted with the scope of knowl -
edge in Bhagavad-gîtå,  will surely be in agreement, or at 
least charmed. For this reason Bhagavad-gîtå  is the most 
widely read literature on theistic science in the world.
Bhagavad-gitaAtheism is certainly not a new phenomena as there have 
always been such thinkers since ancient times. Yet atheism 
in modern times seems driven more as a reaction to fanat -
ical religious dogma than by rational argument. Indeed, 
often times the arguments of the atheist are as irrational as 
those of religious fanatics. When presented with an intel -
ligent proposal, a rationalist should be willing to accept 
it, regardless of where that proposal leads, even if it leads 
to undermine his atheistic world view. Such would be the 
mentality of a real seeker of truth or science.
For the most part, in the modern arena of debate between 
theists and atheists, the student of Bhagavad-gîtå  would not 
side with either because both are predominately ignorant of 
higher knowledge. Coming in contact with Bhagavad-gîtå,  
both the atheists and religious fanatics are silenced because 
within the Gîtå lies the most definitive knowledge of the 
Absolute Truth ever revealed to the world."

If someone were to ask, “Where is K®ß√a?” one might 
respond with another question: “Where isn’t K®ß√a?” 
Bhagavad-gitaAfter turning over every stone and grain of sand in the 
universe, one would be hard-pressed to find something 
or somewhere that is not K®ß√a. Ultimately K®ß√a per -
vades everything in the entire universe and beyond. He is 
uniquely an individual, our dearest friend, our well-wisher 
and the speaker of Bhagavad-gîtå.
It may be interesting to note that in the history of the

Çrî K®ß√a has mentioned those that drink soma . In 
ancient times, some 10,000 years ago, soma  was a celestial 
elixir taken by the performers of certain Vedic rituals that 
was meant to elevate one to higher planets. Soma  was not 
Bhagavad-gitasimply an intoxicant, as some readers of the Bhagavad-gîtå  
have surmised. Only those fully conversant in the three 
Vedas  who were expert in performing Vedic rituals were 
allowed to drink soma . Due to the passage of time, we do 
not know exactly how soma  was made, but we do know 
that it was an elixir and not simply an intoxicant like wine, 
whisky or gañjå.
Those who are conversant in the Vedas  reach the higher 
planets and enjoy celestial pleasures. K®ß√a says that when 
their pious credit is exhausted, they again enter the mortal 
plane of Earth. Therefore, the understanding is that all 
endeavours for material pleasure are temporary, even those 
experienced in higher planets.
But for the bhakti-yogî  there is no need to perform com -
plicated and costly Vedic rituals because all the purposes 
of such ceremonies are fulfilled by acts of devotion and 
surrender to K®ß√a. The intimacy of the bhakti-yogîs  with 
K®ß√a is such that He proclaims that He carries what they 
lack and preserves what they have. This is the extension of 
K®ß√a’s shelter ( åçraya ), for those who surrender to Him. 
This theme is repeated throughout the Bhagavad-gîtå."

No one can live in this world without consuming 
something. There are some yogîs in India that try to avoid 
entanglement with this material world to the extreme. To 
this end they give up clothing, food and even water. But 
because they do not recognise K®ß√a as the proprietor and 
enjoyer of all things, they eventually fall down from their 
position of false renunciation. We say ‘false renunciation’ 
because real renunciation means to renounce the idea of 
oneself being the proprietor and enjoyer and to recognise 
K®ß√a as the proprietor and the enjoyer of everything.
In the stage of real renunciation, one offers everything 
first to K®ß√a and accepts only the remnants of such offer -
ings for his maintenance. The process of offering food to 
K®ß√a by chanting appropriate mantras  is to be learned 
from the guru. When food is offered to K®ß√a by mantra  
the food becomes ‘K®ß√anised’. This is called prasådam , or 
K®ß√a’s mercy.
Çrî K®ß√a says that if one offers Him with devotion 
a leaf, flowers, fruits or some water He will accept that. 
Chapter 9239
This means that non-vegetarian foodstuff such as meat, 
fish and eggs, as well as preparations containing such 
things are not offerable to K®ß√a. Food offerable to K®ß√a 
includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, grains and milk products. 
It should be noted that being Gopåla, the protector of the 
cows, K®ß√a is very fond of milk products such as yogurt, 
butter etc. A diet of such food offered to K®ß√a will make 
one healthy and fit for the practice of yoga as well as free 
from karmic  reactions."

It is important to note here that Çrî K®ß√a says that He 
is equal to all living beings. That is to say that K®ß√a has 
no ‘chosen people’. Everyone is equal in His eyes as His 
eternal parts and parcels. K®ß√a does not arbitrarily cause 
one person to enjoy life and another to suffer. Enjoyment 
and suffering are the results of one’s own pious or impious 
activities in this life and in past lives.
When one approaches K®ß√a, He reciprocates directly 
with that person. One does not have to be born in a par -
ticular country, family, religion, caste, gender or race to 
approach K®ß√a. Nor is one first required to perform 
certain pious activities such as penances or charity before 
one can approach Him. The door is open to everyone and 
K®ß√a reciprocates with each individual accordingly.
But there is also no doubt that those who are deeply 
devoted to K®ß√a and have taken shelter of Him com -
pletely, are very dear to Him and at the end of life they 
will surely come to K®ß√a in His Supreme Abode.

Çrî K®ß√a is unknown and unknowable. He is adhokßaja  
– beyond the reach of the senses, beyond the comprehen -
sion of the mind and intelligence. No amount of ascending 
endeavours on the part of the living beings can reach K®ß√a, 
but in an instant He can descend to reveal Himself. Though 
K®ß√a is their origin, not even the demigods and the great 
sages such as Brahmå, Indra, Sanaka, Durvåså, Marîci and 
others know K®ß√a as He is. But one who is K®ß√a’s dev -
otee, the bhakti-yogî , knows K®ß√a as the Supreme Person 
situated in the core of his heart.
sa vai puµsåµ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokßaje
ahaituky-apratihatå yayåtmå suprasîdati
The topmost dharma  for mankind is that by which 
they can attain devotion unto the Supreme Person, 
who is adhokßaja  and who cannot be known by the 
material senses. Such bhakti-yoga  must be unmo -
tivated and uninterrupted to fully satisfy the self. 
(Çrîmad Bhågavatam 1.2.6)
K®ß√a gives birth to creation and to all things, but He 
Himself is without birth. Still, when K®ß√a appears on 
Earth, as He did some 5,000 years ago to speak Bhaga -
vad-gîtå,  He accepts His devotees Vasudeva and Devakî 
as His parents and appears as the sun seems to manifest 
from the ocean at the beginning of each day. K®ß√a first 
revealed Himself in the heart of Vasudeva and then trans -
ferred Himself to the heart of Devakî. From there He 
appeared from her heart into the world. It is inconceivable, 
but K®ß√a appears in the world without taking birth.
Chapter 10247
The great Bhagavad-gîtå  commentator Çrî Viçvanåtha 
Cakravartî says that the power of K®ß√a to be eternally 
unborn and at the same time take birth is due to K®ß√a’s 
inconceivable energy ( acintya-çakti ). If K®ß√a were not 
inconceivable ( acintya ) then He would not be the Supreme 
Person. Viçvanåtha confirms that one who understands 
this is never bewildered and is free from all karma ."

which is unfavourable.

there is no doubt."

Verses eight to eleven of this chapter are said to con -
tain the ontological substance of Bhagavad-gîtå.  Herein, 
Çrî K®ß√a establishes Himself as the source of the mate -
rial and spiritual worlds, and the origin of Brahman and 
Paramåtmå. By the use of the word sarvasya , meaning 
‘everything’, He also establishes Himself as the origin of 
Nåråya√a in Vaiku√†ha (the Master of all potencies).
In the pantheon of demigods we find that Brahmå 
is master of Satya-loka, Çiva is the master of Çiva-loka, 
Indra the master of Indra-loka, but nowhere do we find 
Chapter 10251
it said that anyone is master and origin of everyone and 
everything except Çrî K®ß√a. The understanding that K®ß√a 
is sarvasya  compels the wise to worship K®ß√a in love with 
all their hearts.
K®ß√a says, mac-cittå  – always think of Me and med -
itate on Me;  mad-gata-prå√å –  dedicate your life to Me. 
In association with the wise engage in discussions about 
Me ( kathayanta ), enlivening and enlightening each other 
(bodhayanta ). This is the proper way of meditation and 
engagement for the mind and senses.
Discussing about K®ß√a is called k®ß√a-kathå,  or çrava√a 
and kîrtana  – hearing and chanting. This means to hear and 
chant Bhagavad-gîtå , Çrîmad Bhågavatam and other such 
literature and to perform sa∫kîrtana , the congregational 
chanting of the mahå-mantra :
hare k®ß√a hare k®ß√a k®ß√a k®ß√a hare hare
hare råma hare råma råma råma hare hare
This hearing and chanting of the name and activities 
of K®ß√a constitutes the topmost system of yoga. K®ß√a 
verifies in the Padma Purå√a  that He resides wherever His 
name is chanted:
nåhaµ tiß†håmi vaiku√†he yoginåµ h®dayeßu vå
tatra tiß†håmi nårada yatra gåyanti mad bhaktå˙
I do not reside in Vaiku√†ha, nor in the hearts of 
the lesser yogîs. I remain where My devotees engage 
in glorifying My activities and chanting My name. 
(Padma Purå√a )
Bhagavad-gitaAltogether, there are nine processes in bhakti-yoga  to 
fully engage oneself in devotion to K®ß√a. Of these, hearing 
and chanting are the first and foremost:
çrava√aµ kîrtanaµ viß√o˙ smara√aµ påda-sevanam
arcanaµ vandanaµ dåsyaµ sakhyam åtma-nivedanam
iti puµsårpitå viß√au bhaktiç cen nava-lakßanå
Hearing and chanting the mahå-mantra  and the 
activities of Viß√u or K®ß√a, remembering Him, 
serving His lotus feet, offering Him respectful wor -
ship, offering prayers to Him, becoming His servant, 
considering Him as one’s dearest friend, and surren -
dering everything to Him. These nine processes are 
accepted as bhakti-yoga . (Çrîmad Bhågavatam  7.5.23)
In verse 10 we find the word prîti-pürvakam . Prîti 
means love, but this love should not be confused with the 
love and affections of this material world which are shared 
between conditioned living beings. Prîti is the state of pure 
affection wherein no expression of selfishness or mundane 
lust can be found. Such love is the requirement for wor -
shipping K®ß√a and such love is the key to an eternal bond 
with Him. Those who have attained such love for K®ß√a by 
bhakti-yoga  are continuously empowered by Him with the 
inspiration of pure devotion ( buddhi-yoga ), by which they 
may come to Him.
K®ß√a dwells in the hearts of all living beings as the 
Paramåtmå, the Super Consciousness, and directs the wan -
derings of everyone. When one desires to know K®ß√a, to 
serve K®ß√a and to enter into an eternal relationship with 
Him, then out of compassion for them, K®ß√a personally 
Chapter 10253
manifests in their hearts and destroys with the shining 
lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance. It is 
said that K®ß√a is light and ignorance is darkness:
k®ß√a-sürya-sama måyå haya andhakåra
yåhå∫ k®ß√a tåhå∫ nåhi måyåra adhikåra
K®ß√a is compared to the sun and måyå  (ignorance) 
is like the darkness. Wherever there is K®ß√a there 
can never be any darkness. ( Caitanya-caritåm®ta, 
Madhya-lîlå  22.31)
Wherever light appears darkness is vanquished. Thus, 
when K®ß√a personally appears in the heart of the bhak-
ti-yogî,  all darkness and despair vanish and one is supremely 
enlightened. This is the quintessence of Bhagavad-gîtå."

Anuv®tti
Arjuna accepts all that Çrî K®ß√a has said and says that 
only K®ß√a actually knows Himself. The Absolute Truth 
is infinite and the living beings, like Arjuna, are finite and 
thus are inherently unable to fully comprehend the splen -
dour of K®ß√a. Yet for Arjuna to hear of such splendours 
is spiritual food for meditation.
Arjuna addresses K®ß√a as yogî, the Master of mystic 
powers, and asks how he should meditate upon Him. In 
the remaining verses of this chapter K®ß√a outlines how 
one should think of Him. But in the last verse He con -
cludes by saying that there is no necessity of thinking of 
Bhagavad-gitaHim in an indirect or abstract way, because with just a 
mere portion of His Self, He supports the entire universe. 
Thus K®ß√a indicates to Arjuna that to meditate on His 
personal form is the ultimate meditation."

In the above verses Çrî K®ß√a has stated that all these 
great and wonderful things of the world represent Him. 
K®ß√a states this so that we will understand that whatever 
is famous, beautiful and glorious in this world is manifest 
from Him alone. The splendour of K®ß√a is unlimited, but 
ultimately K®ß√a says that there is no necessity for Arjuna 
to perform indirect meditation when the Absolute Truth 
Bhagavad-gitais standing in front of him. Therefore, K®ß√a suggests to 
Arjuna that he simply meditate on that form.
There is no form of K®ß√a superior to that which was 
standing in front of Arjuna at Kurukßetra, save and except 
for the form of K®ß√a when He appeared as a youth in the 
forest of V®ndåvana on the banks of the River Yamunå, 
casting sidelong glances, His flute in hand and His tran -

three places, appears most effulgent in the light of 
the moon. ( Bhakti-rasåm®ta-sindhu  1.2.239),
K®ß√a, appeared in V®ndåvana, India, 5,237 years ago 
and performed His pastimes of love with His devotees and 
with those who had reached perfection through bhakti-yoga . 
The pastimes of K®ß√a in V®ndåvana are recorded in the 
Tenth Canto of the Çrîmad Bhågavatam  and have inspired 
the students of bhakti-yoga  for the past fifty centuries.
In the final chapter of Bhagavad-gîtå , K®ß√a will inform 
Arjuna that whoever surrenders unto Him will attain the 
Supreme Abode, Goloka V®ndåvana.

By the end of Chapter Ten, Arjuna is completely 
convinced that Çrî K®ß√a is the Supreme Person and that 
all creation manifests from Him and remains in Him after 
annihilation. But in order that future generations may not 
mistake K®ß√a for an ordinary man or simply a philoso -
pher, Arjuna requests K®ß√a to reveal His universal form 
(viçvarüpa ) – the form of K®ß√a wherein everything in the 
universe is contained. This form cannot be seen by any 
independent endeavour, but completely depends on the 
mercy of K®ß√a for Arjuna to behold.
Arjuna also knows that in the future unscrupulous men 
will claim to be God and mislead ignorant people. There -
fore, Arjuna wants K®ß√a to show His universal form as the 
benchmark so that anyone claiming to be God should be 
able to show the universal form to confirm their position.
Indeed, Arjuna’s foresight was accurate. Since the time 
of K®ß√a, and especially in modern times, many so-called 
‘godmen’ have stepped forward in society and claimed to 
be K®ß√a or God incarnate. Unfortunately, the masses of 
people are so ignorant that they accept such impostors. 
The greatest misfortune befalls a person when he or she 
Chapter 11271
claims to be God, or when a person accepts another human 
as God. This is without a doubt the darkest ignorance. The 
ˆçopanißad  warns of this as follows:
andhaµ tama˙ praviçanti ye’vidyåm upåsate
tato bhüya iva te tamo ya u vidyåyåµ ratå˙
Those who engage in the worship of false things 
enter into the darkest region of ignorance. But those 
who have knowledge, yet do not correct others, enter 
into even darker regions. ( ˆçopanißad  9)
Çrî K®ß√a is addressed by Arjuna as the Supreme 
Person (Parameçvara ), and the Master of all yogic powers 
(Yogeçvara ) because Arjuna knows that K®ß√a will be able 
to show him the universal form, thus distinguishing K®ß√a 
once and for all as the Supreme Being."

Yet you are unable to perceive this with your present eyes, 
therefore I will give you divine vision. Now behold My

Anuv®tti
If one gazes out into the universe with his eyes or even 
with a modern telescope one should not expect to see the 
universal form as was shown to Arjuna. The universal form 
Chapter 11273
is not possible to perceive with the eyes of this material 
body. For such a vision as Arjuna was to receive, one needs 
divine eyes. In other words, Arjuna’s vision of the universal 
form was subjective and could only be revealed by K®ß√a.
Within that vision Arjuna was able to see in one place 
all that is, all that was, all that will ever be, everything 
moving and non-moving in an instant. As we will see in 
this chapter, after seeing the universal form of K®ß√a which 
Arjuna describes as wonderful, astonishing, fiery, terrible 
and devastating, he becomes fearful and asks K®ß√a to once 
again show him His charming and beautiful form as the 
Supreme Person."

The universal form of Çrî K®ß√a is one that invokes 
great awe, reverence and laudations from the beholder, 
but factually speaking, a devotee of K®ß√a is not charmed 
by such a display. Awe and reverence borders on fear and 
as we shall see, Arjuna does indeed become fearful as he 
continues to behold K®ß√a’s universal form. Fear does not 
encourage a loving relationship with the Supreme. There -
fore, the universal form of K®ß√a is not very important for 
students of bhakti-yoga,  only in as much as it proves to 
demonstrate that unless one can show the universal form, 
one should not be accepted as God.
Factually, there are different avatåras  of K®ß√a that 
appear in the universe at scheduled times and these have 
been mentioned by Jayadeva Gosvåmî as follows:
vedån uddharate jaganti vahate bhü-golam udbibhrate
daityaµ dårayate baliµ chalayate kßatra-kßayaµ kurvate
Bhagavad-gitapaulastyaµ jayate halaµ kalayate kåru√yam åtanvate
mlecchån mürchayate daçåk®ti-k®te k®ß√åya tubhyaµ nama˙
O K®ß√a, I offer my respects unto You, who appear 
in the forms of these ten avatåras . As Matsya You 
rescue the Vedas , and as Kürma You carry the Man -
dara Mountain on Your back. As Varåha You lift up 
the Earth planet with Your tusks, and as Narasiµha 
You tear open the chest of the daitya , Hira√yakaçipu. 
In the form of Våmana You delude the daitya  king 
Bali by requesting only three steps of land from him, 
and then You take the whole universe from him by 
expanding Your strides. As Paraçuråma You slay all 
the wicked warriors, and as Råmacandra You fight 
the råkßasa  king Råva√a. As Balaråma You carry a 
plough with which You subdue the wicked and You 
draw the River Yamunå towards You. As Buddha 
You show compassion towards all the living beings 
that are suffering in this world, and at the end of the 
Kali-yuga You appear as Kalki in order to bewilder 
the mlecchas . (Gîtå Govinda  1.12)
In reading the Bhagavad-gîtå  one sees repetition in many 
places. This however is not a flaw but an embellishment 
due to ecstasy. The åcårya  Baladeva Vidyåbhüßa√a con -
firms this ( prasåde vismaye harße dvi-trîr-uktaµ na dußyati ) 
as does the famous commentator on Bhagavad-gîtå A.C. 
Bhaktivedånta Svåmî Prabhupåda, who writes in his pur -
port to verse nineteen as follows:
There is no limit to the extent of the six opulences 
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here and in 
Chapter 11279
many other places there is repetition, but according 
to the scriptures, repetition of the glories of K®ß√a is 
not a literary weakness. It is said that at a time of 
bewilderment or wonder or of great ecstasy, statements 
are repeated over and over. That is not a flaw."

Anuv®tti
Seeing the universal form, Arjuna has now become 
anxious and is on the verge of forgetting who Çrî K®ß√a 
actually is. Therefore, we can understand from Arjuna’s 
situation that the great power, opulence, majesty, devasta -
tion and utter horror seen by him does not serve to draw 
us closer to the Absolute Truth. 
Nature worship is not included in bhakti-yoga . The 
Truth is present in nature, but one must know what that 
Truth is beforehand. One cannot achieve self-realisation 
Bhagavad-gitasimply by contemplation on, or simple appreciation of 
nature alone. Meditation on the Absolute Truth is not 
impersonal or abstract as previously mentioned. The per -
sonal form of K®ß√a as a charming youth with a threefold 
bending form as Çyåmasundara, adorned with forest flow -
ers, dressed in bright yellow garments, while playing His 
flute under a tree on the banks of the River Yamunå is the 
most cherished object of meditation for all great sages and 
yogîs. This is described in the following verses:
sat-pu√∂arîka-nayanaµ meghåbhaµ vaidyutåmbaram
dvi-bhujaµ jñåna-mudrå∂hyaµ vana-målinam îçvaram
I meditate on Çrî K®ß√a, whose beautiful eyes are like 
lotuses, whose hue is that of a new rain cloud, whose 
clothes are as bright as lightning, who possesses two 
arms, who is adorned by a beautiful forest garland, 
and whose hand shows the jñåna-mudrå  indicating 
divine knowledge. ( Gopåla-tåpan î Upanißad  9)

I meditate on two-armed K®ß√a, who is dark like 
a monsoon rain cloud, dressed in yellow garments, 
garlanded with forest flowers, crowned with a pea -
cock feather and decorated with lotuses. His face 
is as splendid as millions of moons and His eyes 
move restlessly. His forehead is marked with tilaka  
made of sandalwood paste and musk. He is adorned 
with earrings that resemble two rising suns, and His 
perspiration-anointed cheeks are like two glistening 
mirrors. His eyes with raised eyebrows above them 
playfully glance at His beloved’s face. The tip of His 
graceful raised nose is decorated with a glistening 
pearl. His lips are red like the bimba  fruit and are 
splendid in the moonlight of His teeth. His hands 
are splendid with bracelets, armlets, and jewelled 
rings. He holds a flute in His left lotus hand, His 
waist is splendid with a graceful belt and His feet are 
splendid with beautiful anklets. His eyes are rest -
less with the nectar of His divine activities and He 
jokes with His friends, making them laugh again and 
again. He sits on a jewelled throne under a desire 
tree in the forest of V®ndåvana with His beloved. 
In this way one should meditate on Çrî K®ß√a. ( San-

The fate of the world is ultimately sealed, but the 
opportunity for the conditioned living beings to attain 
enlightenment and transcend the world of birth and 
death is open to all. Çrî K®ß√a say, kålo’smi loka-kßaya-
k®t – “ Time I am, the mighty destroyer of worlds.” This 
is the fate of the world. Time is the great enemy and it 
eventually devours all things. This insurmountable time 
is the energy of K®ß√a.

The twelve months and six seasons are like cooking 
spoons. The sun is the fire for cooking. Day and 
night are the fuel consumed by the sun. Ignorance is 
the cooking pot and the living beings are within that 
pot being cooked by time. That is the way of this 
world! ( Mahåbhårata, Vana-parva  313.118)
In 1945 when the first atomic bomb was detonated 
at test facilities in New Mexico, atomic physicist Robert 
Bhagavad-gitaOppenheimer remembered verse 32 of this chapter as a just 
assessment of the moment. Years later, when asked about 
his feelings concerning the bomb, he made the following 
statement:
We knew the world would not be the same. A few people 
laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. 
I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the 
Bhagavad-gîtå . Viß√u is trying to persuade the Prince 
(Arjuna) that he should do his duty and to impress him 
takes on his multi-armed form and says, “Now I am 
Death, the destroyer of the worlds.”
Indeed, from then till now, the world seems to hang by 
a thread and our imminent destruction (seemingly at our 
own hands) could come at any moment. This, it appears, is 
the ultimate fate of the world – certain annihilation."

Arjuna has been showering praises upon Çrî K®ß√a after 
seeing His universal form of great wonder, but then he 
regrets that in many instances he may have offended K®ß√a 
by addressing Him as, “O K®ß√a,” “O friend,” or by play -
ing or relaxing with K®ß√a. Thus Arjuna requests K®ß√a’s 
forgiveness for any transgressions that he might have made 
and then earnestly requests K®ß√a to show him His four-
armed form as Nåråya√a.
Bhagavad-gitaArjuna has an eternal relationship with K®ß√a in friend -
ship, ( sakhya-rasa ), and as such he is only momentarily 
forgetful of that. Similarly, all living beings have an eternal 
relationship with K®ß√a either as a friend, servant, parent or 
lover and this relationship can be thus discovered through 
the process of bhakti-yoga.  That the living being’s relation -
ship with K®ß√a is eternal is confirmed as follows:
sa nityo 'nitya-sambandha˙ prak®tiç ca paraiva så
The living being is eternal and has an eternal rela -
tionship with K®ß√a from beginningless and endless

Because Arjuna has an eternal relationship with Çrî 
K®ß√a and not with Nåråya√a in Vaiku√†ha, K®ß√a could 
see that he was not yet peaceful even after seeing His form 
Bhagavad-gitaas Nåråya√a and thus K®ß√a resumed His original two-
armed form as Çyåmasundara. Those who have a direct 
relationship with K®ß√a are most fortunate and are never 
satisfied by seeing any other avatåra  of K®ß√a besides that 
of His original form. A similar situation is narrated in the 
book B®had-bhågavatåm®ta,  wherein Gopa Kumåra found 
himself in Vaiku√†ha in the presence of Nåråya√a, but did 
not feel comfortable or at home. Because Gopa Kumåra has 
an eternal relationship with K®ß√a in Goloka V®ndåvana, 
even being in the presence of the majestic Nåråya√a in 
Vaiku√†ha could not pacify him. Thus he continued his 
journey until at last, he reached the Supreme Abode and 
the sweet embrace of K®ß√a. Such is the great fortune of 
K®ß√a’s devotee, who is always guided by Him and ulti -
mately attains His sweet embrace.

Bhagavån Çrî K®ß√a replied: Those who fix their minds 
upon Me, who constantly glorify Me and possess great 
faith – I consider them to be most perfect.
Anuv®tti
Up to this point in Bhagavad-gîtå , Çrî K®ß√a has 
explained His personal, impersonal and universal aspects as 
well as the various types of yogîs. Now Arjuna asks for spe -
cial clarification as to which is the better path – the path of 
bhakti-yoga  centred on K®ß√a directly and performed with 
acts of devotion , or the impersonal path that tries to focus 
on K®ß√a’s Brahman effulgence ( brahma-jyoti ).
Bhagavad-gitaThis is a question for many persons starting on the 
path of transcendence – which path is better, the personal 
or the impersonal? Here, Çrî K®ß√a says that the personal 
path is best. The bhakti-yogî, who is fixed in meditation on 
K®ß√a’s form of beauty, who constantly glorifies Him with 
great faith and determination is the best of yogîs.
The bhakti-yogîs  that engage on the personal path of 
self-realisation are called Vaiß√avas. Those on the imper -
sonal path are of three types – Brahmavådîs (Vedåntists), 
Çünyavådîs (Buddhists) and Måyåvådîs (Ça∫karites). 
Brahmavådîs are those who seek to merge the self ( åtmå) 
into the bodily effulgence of K®ß√a. Çünyavådîs seek to 
annihilate everything and enter the void ( çünya ) and the 
Måyåvådîs seek to become God themselves.
The Brahmavådîs seek to merge with the Brahman 
effulgence, but they have little or no knowledge of the 
personal form of K®ß√a. Thus they only reach K®ß√a after 
many lifetimes as will be explained in verse 4. In the annals 
of self-realisation, there are many instances of yogîs and 
Brahmavådîs failing to achieve Brahman realisation and 
even accounts of those such as the Four Kumåras, Vasiß†ha 
Muni, Çukadeva Gosvåmî and others, who after achieving 
Brahman realisation, abandoned that for the higher bliss 
of bhakti-yoga.  For the seekers of çünya  there is never 
success because there is no çünya. There is no void any -
where. There is nothing outside or beyond K®ß√a and so 
the Çünyavådîs face great disappointment at the end of 
life. The Måyåvådîs reject the personal form of K®ß√a as 
a manifestation of måyå  (illusion) and want to become 
God themselves. Måyåvådîs are considered offenders and 
return to the world of birth and death.
Chapter 12305
Throughout the Bhagavad-gîtå , K®ß√a’s statements are 
consistent in that He repeatedly confirms that of all paths, 
bhakti-yoga  is the best. Among all types of yogîs, jñånîs , 
philosophers and philanthropists, the bhakti-yogî  who is 
fully absorbed in K®ß√a without any material desires or the 
desire for liberation, is the best and is very dear to Him.
anyåbhilåßitå-çünyaµ jñåna-karmådy-anåv®tam
ånukülyena k®ß√ånu-çîlanaµ bhaktir-uttamå
In the highest plane of bhakti-yoga  one is devoid of 
all material desires, material activities and the desire 
for liberation. Such bhakti-yoga  must be favoura -
bly performed according to K®ß√a’s desire. ( Bhak-
ti-rasåm®ta-sindhu  1.1.11)
It is further confirmed by the greatest impersonal phi -
losopher of all time, Çrîpåda Ådi Ça∫kara, who chastised 
his disciples and told them that they should just worship 
K®ß√a (Govinda). Nothing else is required.
bhaja govindaµ bhaja govindaµ bhaja govindaµ mü∂ha-mate

O foolish students, your repetition of grammatical 
rules and your philosophical speculation will not 
save you at the time of death. Just worship Govinda, 
worship Govinda, worship Govinda! ( Moha-mud -

Brahman is the bodily effulgence of Çrî K®ß√a. As such, 
it is eternal, unfathomable, inconceivable, unchanging, 
all-pervading, immovable and all-powerful. This is stated 
in the Viß√u Purå√a as follows:
Chapter 12307
yat tad avyaktam ajaram acintyam ajam akßayam
anirdeçyam arüpaµ ca på√i-pådådy-asaµyutam
vibhuµ sarva-gataµ nityaµ bhüta-yonim akåra√am
vyåpya-vyåpta yata˙ sarvaµ tad vai paçyanti süraya˙
The Brahman feature of the Supreme is unmanifest, 
unaffected by time, inconceivable, without material 
origin, free from decay and diminution, indescrib -
able, formless, without hands, feet, or other limbs, 
all-powerful, all-pervading, eternal, the origin of all 
material elements, without any material cause, pres -
ent in everything, although nothing is situated in it, 
the source of the material cosmos and the object of 
vision for the demigods. ( Viß√u Purå√a  6.5.66-67).
That effulgence of K®ß√a is non-different from Him 
and shines like millions, and millions of suns.
våsudevåd abhinnas tu vahny-arkendu-çata-prabham
våsudevo ‘pi bhagavåµs tad-dharmå parameçvara˙
svåµ dîptiµ kßobhayaty eva tejaså tena vai yutam
prakåça-rüpo bhagavån acyutam cåsak®d dvija
The effulgence of the impersonal Brahman is 
like unlimited fires, suns and moons. Brahman is 
non-different from Våsudeva (K®ß√a). Våsudeva is 
full of all auspicious qualities and His nature is that 
He is the Supreme Controller. When He removes 
the covering of His own Brahman effulgence, K®ß√a 
reveals His original, eternal, transcendental form. 
(Nårada-pañcaråtra )
Bhagavad-gitaThe concept of liberation in the impersonal Brahman 
is often sought by those who are frustrated with material 
existence, but who have no knowledge of K®ß√a. Certainly a 
sense of detachment and renunciation from material activ -
ities is laudable, but K®ß√a says that path is more trouble 
than it is worth.
If one endeavours for the perfection of life by con -
trolling the senses, being equipoised in all circumstances, 
cultivates the impersonal Brahman conception, and at the 
same time is dedicated to helping all living beings, then 
such a person may eventually reach K®ß√a consciousness. 
The impersonal path, K®ß√a says, is very troublesome and 
difficult to attain. Therefore, it is expected that ascending 
such a path can extend over many lifetimes and there is also 
the chance of total failure and loss.
The Brahmavådîs must cultivate sense-control etc. as 
mentioned above with the study of Vedånta . After many 
lifetimes, by cultivating such knowledge, when the Brah -
mavådî understands that K®ß√a is everything ( våsudeva˙ 
sarvam iti) , he at last reaches Him. The Çünyavådî and 
the Måyåvådî never reach K®ß√a until they adopt the path 
of bhakti-yoga . However, a Vaiß√ava may come to K®ß√a 
consciousness in one lifetime."

For those who are embodied, the ocean of material exist -
ence is difficult to cross because it is fraught with many dan -
gers. But if one takes shelter of the lotus feet of Çrî K®ß√a, 
then He delivers one from the ocean of misery as easily as one 
is ferried across the water in a boat.

to cross that ocean. Yet you should cross that dif -
ficult ocean simply by making a boat of the lotus 
feet of K®ß√a, which are most worthy of worship.

renunciation of material gain, for by such renunciation 
one finds peace.
Anuv®tti
Bhakti-yoga  has two approaches, the direct and the 
indirect. Çrî K®ß√a tells Arjuna in verse 8 that the direct 
approach is to, “Fix your mind and intelligence on Me 
alone.” Such a stage is called rågånugå-bhakti,  or sponta -
neous devotion which is independent of the support of 
rules and regulations. However, this stage of rågånugå-
bhakti  is not easily achieved, especially for beginners. In 
that case K®ß√a recommends the indirect approach to 
rågånugå-bhakti  which is the constant practice of rules and 
regulations known as sådhana-bhakti.  If such a practice is 
not possible then K®ß√a suggests that one should work for 
Him. If one cannot do that, then He says that one should 
renounce the results of one’s activities and offer them to 
Him. If one cannot do that, then one should engage in the 
cultivation of knowledge to understand what the body is, 
Bhagavad-gitawhat the åtmå is and who K®ß√a is. One will then gradually 
advance from whatever stage they are at and progress to the 
topmost stage of approaching K®ß√a directly in rågånugå-
bhakti . This is also stated in Çrî Brahma-saµhitå  as follows:
prabuddhe jñåna-bhaktibhyåm åtmany ånanda-cinmayî
udety anuttamå bhaktir bhagavat-prema-lakßa√å
When transcendental experience awakens by means 
of knowledge and devotion, the highest devotion 
which is distinguished by the presence of pure love 
for Çrî K®ß√a, the beloved of the åtmå, awakens in 
one’s heart. ( Brahma-saµhitå  5.58)"

Everyone in the world would like to see peace and 
harmony, but what prevails is quite the opposite. Verses 
thirteen to twenty offer a simple solution to most of the 
problems in today’s world, and that is the self-improve -

ment of the individual. In other words, if people were to 
cultivate the qualities that Çrî K®ß√a has mentioned here, 
the world would be a far better place. As it is now, the 
world is no place for a gentleman. Being  devoid of hatred, 
being friendly and compassionate to all living beings, being 
devoid of any sense of possessiveness, free from egotism, 
objective in all circumstances, forgiving, self-controlled, 
and being of strong determination etc. are indeed noble 
qualities. But how are people to develop them?
Independently these qualities, and other desirable qual -
ities of the human being mentioned throughout Bhaga -
vad-gîtå  are difficult to develop. It is seen that sometimes a 
person may possess one, two or three of such qualities, but 
where is that person who has all these qualities?
K®ß√a gives the answer in Bhagavad-gîtå  – become a 
bhakti-yogî,  take shelter of K®ß√a and surrender everything 
to Him. The åtmå is naturally complete with all good 
qualities as could ever be desired by a human being. When 
one’s mind, intelligence, and consciousness are purified 
by being in association with K®ß√a through the process 
of bhakti-yoga,  all desirable qualities develop. Therefore, 
the open secret to life is that everyone should become a 
yogî in bhakti-yoga . Then the world would become a much 
better place.
Above all good qualities is the quality of devotion to 
the Supreme Person, from which all other good qualities 
manifest in great abundance. One does not become dear to 
K®ß√a simply by independently developing good qualities. 
All such qualities must be dovetailed with the quality of 
devotion. One who approaches life in that way is a true 
bhakti-yogî  and is very dear to K®ß√a.

Anuv®tti
The basis of knowledge, namely the ability to differen -
tiate between matter, consciousness and Super Conscious -
ness will further be explained in this chapter. In the last 
few centuries western scientific understanding suggests that 
consciousness arises out of an inexplicable combination of 
material elements. In other words, they conclude that the 
body is the self. Bhagavad-gîtå  however, considers such an 
understanding to be ignorance. Without understanding the 
difference between material nature ( prak®ti ) and the self 
(kßetrajña ) who is the conscious knower of the body, there 
is no basis of real knowledge. Both are distinct from one 
another and one who understands this is truly learned.
The material body composed of the three subtle ele -
ments (mind, intelligence and false ego) and the five gross 
elements (earth, water, fire, air and space) is known as 
the field. The indwelling consciousness is known as the 
knower of the field, and the Super Consciousness situated 
within all bodies and within the individual consciousness 
is the knower of all fields of activity. This is the subject of 
this chapter, upon knowing which one becomes liberated 
from material bondage."

Anuv®tti
Here, the greater wealth of knowledge by which a human 
being can achieve the perfection of life has been described. 
This detailed explanation by Çrî K®ß√a leads one to an under -
standing that promotes self-realisation and frees one from 
ignorance. Unfortunately, this knowledge is completely 
lacking in modern societies, both eastern and western. All 
contemporary fields of knowledge i.e. biology, physics, math -
ematics and philosophy lead one to accept the body as the 
self and to accept gratification of one’s mind, intelligence, 
ego and senses as the goal of life. Such an understanding is 
utterly devoid of the real purpose of life, considering that this 
one life is the all in all and that after death there is nothing.
The material world is a place of birth, death, old age 
and disease and is sometimes referred to as m®tyu-loka or 
the planet of death. Birth, death, old age and disease are 
indeed the real problems facing all living beings regardless 
of race, nationality or belief. Any knowledge that does not 
aim to put an end to these miseries is certainly incomplete 
at best. There are, of course, medicines, drugs, surgery and 
medical machines to ease the pain of birth, slow the old 
age process, cure some diseases and prolong the process of 
dying, but these are only stopgaps or temporary solutions. 
One should recognise these problems of life and be 
inquisitive as to where the real solution is to be found.
Bhagavad-gitaContrary to modern scientific and philosophical under -
standing, the Bhagavad-gîtå  says that this one life is not the 
all in all, and that there is life after death. There was life 
before coming to this material world and that life contin -
ues eternally. All that really changes is the type of body 
one has. For the pious there is future life in higher plan -
ets enjoying celestial pleasures, for the ignorant there are 
future sojourns within the bodies of lower species such as 
animals or plants, and for the yogî and for those who culti -
vate knowledge of consciousness and Super Consciousness, 
there is future existence beyond the material universes in 
the Vaiku√†ha planets. There, life is eternal and all bodies 
are of the substance known as sac-cid -ånanda  (eternity, 
knowledge and bliss)."

Anuv®tti
As previously mentioned, the Absolute Truth is known 
in three phases of realisation – Brahman, Paramåtmå and 
Bhagavån. The ‘He’ of whom K®ß√a speaks of in these 
verses as being subordinate to Him, yet being the Supreme 
Brahman refers to the Paramåtmå. His hands, feet, eyes and 
ears are everywhere and He is situated in the hearts of all 
living beings. He is all-pervasive throughout the universe, 
Chapter 13327
He divides Himself to be within all things, yet He Himself 
is not divided or diminished – He remains the Complete 
Person. This is stated in the invocation of the ˆçopanißad  
as follows:
oµ pür√am ada˙ pür√am idaµ pür√åt pür√am udacyate
pür√asya pür√am ådåya pür√am evåvaçißyate
The Supreme Person is perfect and complete, and 
because He is completely perfect, all emanations 
from Him, such as this material world, are also 
perfect and complete. Whatever emanates from the 
Complete Person is also complete in itself. Because 
He is the Complete Person, even though so many 
complete units emanate from Him, He remains the 
complete balance.
It would seem that the discourse between the theist and 
the atheist is perpetually in a gridlock. But as mentioned 
in a previous Anuv®tti,  the student of Bhagavad-gîtå  does 
not consider either the so-called theist or the atheist to 
have complete knowledge. It may even be that sometimes 
the atheist is more correct in his opinion than the so-called 
theist. The theist establishes his God, and the atheist, upon 
examining the statements of the so-called theist, discovers 
that the God in question is wrathful, vindictive, jealous, 
vengeful, sadomasochistic etc. In this instance we would 
have to agree with the atheist – there is no such God.
However, the atheist then concludes that in the absence 
of God, the universe and all life within it has come from 
nothing – yet he has no experience or proof that something 
can arise from nothing. His proposal is thus self-defeating.
Bhagavad-gitaBoth ‘God’ and His non-existence are but misconcep -
tions in the minds of the so-called theist and the atheist. 
However, the student of Bhagavad-gîtå  knows that the sub -
ject matter is not a thesis about ‘God’. Bhagavad-gîtå  is a 
discourse aimed at enlightenment in the Absolute Truth. 
The Absolute Truth contains all things known, knowable 
and unknown – before the universe, within the universe, 
after the universe and beyond the universe."

It is described that both material nature ( prak®ti ) and 
the living beings ( jîvåtmå  or purußa ) are without beginning 
(anådi ). This means that material nature and the living 
beings exist as eternal energies of Çrî K®ß√a before the 
process of creation takes place. The living being’s origin 
is in the ta†asthå , or marginal plane, before the onslaught 
of time. In this regard, the origin of the living beings and 
material nature are both anådi , or having no first cause. 
Chapter 13331
They are without a first cause because they are çaktis,  or 
potencies of the Absolute Truth who is Himself without 
origin. In other words, the cause of all causes is Çrî K®ß√a. 
Thus, He is known as sarva-kåra√a-kåra√am.
Though material nature and the living beings are eter -
nal and without beginning, they nonetheless have distinctly 
different qualities and characteristics. They are not the 
same. Material nature is described as the body, senses and 
other elements as well as the transformations of qualities 
such as happiness, distress, lamentation and illusion. The 
living beings are part and parcel of the Supreme Person. 
They are sac-cid-ånanda  – having the constitution of eter -
nity, knowledge and bliss. When the living beings identify 
the self as the material body, they suffer under the miser -
ies of happiness and distress and perpetually transmigrate 
from one body to the next in the cycle of birth and death.
One of the greatest questions in life, namely, “Where 
do we come from?” is certainly answered in Bhagavad-gîtå . 
Yet the use of the word anådi  in verse 20 has encouraged 
some thinkers to conclude that the living beings have 
always been in the material world. In other words, that 
although the living beings are eternal, they begin in the 
material universe and have always been in the material 
universe. This conclusion however is not supported by 
previous åcåryas  of the Bhagavad-gîtå  such as Viçvanåtha 
Cakravartî, Baladeva Vidyåbhüßa√a and others. To them, 
anådi  means beginningless, before time began.
Regarding the origin of the living beings and their 
beginning as anådi,  the Vaiß√ava åcårya  Svåmî B. R. 
Çrîdhara Mahåråja says as follows:
Bhagavad-gitaSince time immemorial, man has inquired about the 
origin of the living being. Who am I? Where have I 
come from? How does the living being first appear in 
this world? From what stage of spiritual existence does 
he fall into the material world?
There are two classes of living beings who come 
into this world. One class comes from the spiritual 
Vaiku√†ha  planets by the necessity of nitya-lîlå,  
the eternal pastimes of K®ß√a. Another comes by 
constitutional necessity. The brahma-jyoti,  the non-
differentiated marginal plane, is the source of infinite 
living beings ( jîvåtmås ), atomic spiritual particles of 
non-differentiated character.
The rays of the transcendental body of the Supreme 
Person are known as the brahma-jyoti , and a ray 
of the brahma-jyoti  is the jîvåtmå . The jîvåtmå  is 
an atom in that effulgence, and the brahma-jyoti  is 
a product of an infinite number of jîvåtmå  atoms. 
Generally, jîvåtmås  emanate from the brahma-jyoti  
which is living and growing. Within the brahma-jyoti , 
their equilibrium is somehow disturbed and movement 
begins. From non-differentiation, differentiation 
begins. From a plain sheet of uniform consciousness, 
individual conscious units grow. And because the 
jîvåtmå  is conscious it is endowed with free will. 
From the marginal position ( ta†asthå-çakti ) they 
choose either the side of exploitation (material world) 
or the side of dedication ( Vaiku√†ha ). K®ß√a bhuli 
sei jîva anådi bahirmukha. Anådi  means that which 
has no beginning. When we enter the land of exploita -
Chapter 13333
tion, we come within the factor of time, space and 
thought. And when we come to exploit, action and 
reaction begins in the negative land of loan.
When the jîvåtmå , by exercise of his free will and out 
of curiosity, first enters into this land – from then he 
becomes a factor of this limited world. But his partic -
ipation is beyond the beginning of this limited world. 
That is why it is said to be anådi. Anådi  means that 
it does not come from within the jurisdiction of this 
limited world.
Once subject to contact with material nature, the living 
beings are then subject to karma , the laws of action and 
reaction. Under these laws the living beings enjoy and suffer 
in various species of life. During their material sojourn, 
the Paramåtmå accompanies the living beings and is ever 
watchful for when they will turn their head towards the 
Absolute Truth. The Paramåtmå directs the wanderings of 
the living beings, and when one desires to know the Truth, 
the Paramåtmå manifests before the living beings as the 
spiritual master who teaches Bhagavad-gîtå  as it is. Hence 
the living being transcends the world of birth and death.
brahmå√∂a brahmite kona bhågyavån jîva
guru-k®ß√a prasåde påya bhakti-latå-bîja
According to their karma , the jîvåtmås  are wandering 
throughout the universe. Some jîvåtmås  who are most 
fortunate receive the mercy of guru and K®ß√a, and 
by such mercy they receive the seed of the creeper of 
devotion. ( Caitanya-caritåm®ta, Madhya-lîlå  19.151)

als etc. Çrî K®ß√a says that all these moving and non-mov -
ing things are a combination of material nature and the 
living beings. One who has deeper vision sees that the 
Super Consciousness is the Controller of all things and is 
situated in the hearts of all living beings, within every atom 
and in between every atom. Such a seer is a true knower 
and realises that consciousness and Super Consciousness 
are both eternal and imperishable.
Bhagavad-gitaA seer of the truth is never degraded by the influences 
of material nature. He gradually rises to perfection and 
attains the Supreme Abode of K®ß√a. Those who are con -
ditioned by material nature and who have no knowledge 
of Super Consciousness wrongly conceive that they are the 
doer of activities, or that they are the overlords of material 
nature. This however is a foolish idea since they themselves 
are helplessly suffering at the hands of death.
For those that have the eyes to see, all forms of life 
indicate the presence of a conscious living being. That 
is to say that not just humans are conscious or that only 
human consciousness is eternal. All things that manifest 
birth, growth, maintenance, reproduction, dwindling and 
death, regardless of higher birth (human) or lower birth 
(animal), are known as eternal beings transmigrating in 
the material world. Thus, one who is friendly, kind and 
compassionate must be so to all forms of life. It is not that 
humans are spared but animals and others can be killed 
or exploited for our pleasure. This idea falls short of the 
vision of Bhagavad-gîtå which sees all living beings as part 
and parcel of the Supreme Person, K®ß√a. Thus, all living 
beings have a right to life."

One who knows and sees the difference between the body

from material bondage, also attains the supreme goal.
Bhagavad-gitaAnuv®tti
The Paramåtmå enters the material nature and makes 
all things possible within that nature, but He Himself is 
never contaminated. He is never in illusion, never under the 
influence of time, never subject to death or the reactions to 
work and the laws of material nature. Super Consciousness 
is always the Master of material nature and material nature 
is always subservient. 
Although the living beings are situated within the mate -
rial body, they do not actually mix or become one with 
it. The living beings are always distinct from the material 
body even when the living beings are conditioned by it. 
One who knows this in relation to Çrî K®ß√a, attains the 
supreme goal of life.

Material nature is compared to a womb and Çrî K®ß√a 
says that He is the seed-giving father ( ahaµ bîja-prada˙ 
pitå). The combination of material nature and the living 
beings thus gives rise to the multitude of life forms which 
are in turn bound by the modes of material nature and 
forced to act under their influence.
The mode of goodness is characterised by freedom from 
impurities, that which gives knowledge, frees one from dis -
tress and conditions one to pleasure and accomplishment. 
Chapter 14347
Passion manifests intense desire, hankering and attachment 
and binds the embodied being to his actions. Ignorance is 
that which bewilders all embodied beings and constrains 
one through confusion, laziness and excessive sleep.
The three modes of material nature thus condition one 
to the illusion of happiness, the attachment to perform 
action, and bewilderment due to an insufficient fund of 
knowledge. The combinations of the modes of nature are 
endless, each fighting with the other for supremacy. Due to 
this, the embodied living beings are in a constant state of 
confusion as to the purpose of life and the consequence is 
the suffering of birth, death, old age and disease."

In the above five verses the characteristics of the three 
modes of nature are further described as well as their influ -
ence over the embodied living being at the time of death. 
When one dies in the mode of goodness, illuminated by 
knowledge, he reaches the higher planets where those of 
great intellect reside. When one dies in the mode of pas -
sion, characterised by greed, selfish activities, ambition, 
restlessness and hankering, he is reborn amongst those 
who are attached to worldly activities. And when the most 
unfortunate amongst men die in the mode of ignorance, 
characterised by darkness, laziness, confusion and delusion, 
they take birth again in the womb of uncivilised people or 
even worse, descend into the animal kingdom to become 
dogs, cats and beasts of burden."

By transcending these three modes that appear within the 
body, one becomes liberated from the miseries of birth, 
Chapter 14351
death, old age and other miseries. Then one tastes the 
nectar of immortality.
Anuv®tti
Bewilderment and conditioning under the modes of 
material nature is difficult to overcome, but it is possible 
when one cultivates the knowledge of Bhagavad-gîtå  and 
applies oneself sincerely to the process of bhakti-yoga . The 
knowledge attained through the study of Bhagavad-gîtå  
enables one to transcend the modes of nature because such 
knowledge is in itself transcendental and free from the 
defects of mistakes ( bhrama ), illusion ( pramåda ), cheating 
(vipralipså ) and false perception ( kara√åpå†ava ). In other 
words, the knowledge contained in Bhagavad-gîtå  is perfect 
and complete. By transcending the modes of nature, Çrî 
K®ß√a promises that one will be liberated from the miseries 
of birth, death, old age and disease and one will taste the 
nectar of immortality. This is also confirmed in the  ˆço-
panißad  as follows:
vidyåµ cåvidyåµ ca yas tad vedobhayaµ saha
avidyayå m®tyuµ tîrtvå vidyayåm®tam açnute
One who transcends ignorance ( avidyå ) and attains 
transcendental knowledge certainly rises above the 
influence of repeated birth and death and tastes the 
nectar of immortality. ( ˆçopanißad  11)
The contemporary world view of advancement of 
knowledge is that knowledge is attained through direct 
evidence, experiment, hypothesis and speculation. This 
process of acquiring knowledge is called åroha-panthå , or 
the ascending process. However, the ascending process 
Bhagavad-gitaof knowledge relies completely on the mind, intelligence 
and senses and is thus subject to the four material defects 
of mistakes, illusion, cheating and false perception. 
Accordingly, no scientific knowledge is perfect, nor can 
it be perfect. Truly, by the admission of many scientists, 
they never really attain the end of knowledge. The more 
they learn, the more there is to learn, or the more they 
learn, the more they discover that their predecessors were 
wrong. In any case, scientists admit that they do not have 
perfect knowledge – death comes and another generation 
of scientists is reduced to dust.
Knowledge that is descending from Çrî K®ß√a and 
through the guru-disciple paramparå  is known as avaroha-
panthå  and is free from material defects. Bhagavad-gîtå  
means the words of Çrî K®ß√a – hearing which enables one 
to achieve the perfection of life before death comes."

Anuv®tti
The symptoms of one who is free from the modes of 
nature are herein described. Such a person is equally dis -
posed to the dualities of the material world. Such a person 
is not affected by happiness and distress because he knows 
the temporary nature of both. The liberated person is con -
tent in the cultivation of the self and is not motivated by 
wealth or distressed by poverty. He sees gold, dirt or a 
simple stone as the same  (sama-loß†åçma-kåñcana˙ ). He is 
Chapter 14355
wise, considering infamy and honour the same and has no 
enemies, as he is impartial to both friends and foes. These 
are the characteristics of one who is transcendentally sit -
uated above the three modes of material nature. Çrîmad 
Bhågavatam  confirms this in the following way:
såttvika˙ kårako ‘sa∫gî rågåndho råjasa˙ sm®ta˙
tåmasa˙ sm®ti-vibhraß†o nirgu√o mad-apåçraya˙
One who works free of attachment is in the mode 
of goodness. One who works with personal desire 
is in the mode of passion. One who works without 
discrimination of right and wrong is in the mode 
of ignorance. But one who takes shelter of K®ß√a 
is understood to be transcendental to the modes of 
material nature. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam  11.25.26)
The liberated person is always situated in bhakti-yoga  
without deviation because he knows Çrî K®ß√a as the 
immortal, imperishable Brahman, the giver of eternal 
wisdom in the form of Bhagavad-gîtå  and the fountainhead 
of supreme bliss.

The form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. 
Indeed, none can fully comprehend where the tree begins, 
where it ends, or where its foundation lies. One must cut 
down this strong-rooted banyan tree with the weapon of 
detachment and search out that place from which, once 
having gone, one never returns. One must take shelter of 
the Supreme Person, from whom all things have originated 
from time immemorial.
Anuv®tti
Herein, the material world is compared to a great 
banyan tree whose roots are above and branches below and 
whose leaves are the Vedic hymns etc. This is an analogy of 
the material world as a reflection of reality, whose origin, 
foundation and end are fully indiscernible to conditioned 
living beings in the grasp of material illusion. One must cut 
through this illusion with the weapon of detachment and 
search out knowledge of the Supreme Abode of K®ß√a. The 
Taittirîya Åra√yaka  says the following:
Chapter 15361
ürdhva-mülam avåk-chåkhaµ v®kßaµ yo veda samprati

He who knows this banyan tree with roots upwards

Whenever the individual being, the master of the body,

grance from its source. 
Anuv®tti
Perfection in bhakti-yoga, or K®ß√a consciousness, is not 
achieved without striving to be free from false pride and 
illusion. To achieve this one should keep company with 
like-minded persons in pursuit of the Absolute Truth. In 
other words one should give up bad association.
asat-sa∫ga tyåga – ei vaiß√ava-åcåra
strî sa∫gî – eka asådhu k®ß√åbhakta åra
A Vaiß√ava ( bhakti-yogî ) should always avoid bad 
association, those who are materially attached, who 
Chapter 15363
are addicted to illicit sex and who are not interested 
in the cultivation of the Absolute Truth. ( Caitan -
ya-caritåm®ta, Madhya-lîlå  22.87)
The Supreme Abode of Çrî K®ß√a is the final destina -
tion of the bhakti-yogî  and K®ß√a says that His abode is not 
illuminated by sun, moon or fire. Not illuminated by sun, 
moon or fire means that the Supreme Abode is beyond the 
reach of the darkness that exists in the material world. In 
the Supreme Abode of K®ß√a, known by great self-realised 
yogîs as Goloka V®ndåvana, everything is filled with the 
self-effulgence of K®ß√a.
na tatra süryo bhåti na candra-tårakaµ
nemå vidyuto bhånti kuto’yam agni˙
tam eva bhåntam anubhåti sarvaµ
tasya bhåså sarvam idaµ vibhåti
The sun does not shine there, nor the moon, nor the 
stars, nor does lightning shine. How then can fire 
burn? When The Supreme Being shines, all these 
shine. Through His effulgence He illuminates all 
things. ( Ka†ha Upanißad  2.2.15)
K®ß√a also says that once attaining that Supreme Abode, 
one never returns to this world of birth and death. The 
material world is filled with unlimited fallibilities, but the 
Supreme Abode is infallible. The fallibility of the material 
world includes envy, greed, lust, hate, vengefulness etc. but 
these material qualities cannot enter the abode of K®ß√a.
Some thinkers have postulated that the living beings in 
this material world have originally fallen from their eternal 
Bhagavad-gitaposition in the Supreme Abode. Such persons are known 
as ‘Fall- vådîs ’. According to the thinking of the ‘Fall-
vådîs ’, the Supreme Abode is fallible and subject to envy, 
dissatisfaction, greed, hate and so on. The word ‘fallible’ 
comes from the Latin word fallere  that means ‘to deceive’. 
In order to deceive there must be ignorance, forgetfulness 
and suspicion etc. However, considering that no material 
qualities exist in the Supreme Abode, it is not possible for 
any liberated living being there to become contaminated 
by material qualities. 
K®ß√a says that once going to that abode one never 
returns to the material world ( yad gatvå na nivartante ). 
K®ß√a does not say that going again  to that Supreme Abode 
one never returns. Therefore, it is understood by K®ß√a’s 
own words that no one falls from the Supreme Abode.
All living beings in the spiritual and material worlds are 
eternally K®ß√a’s parts and particles – mamaivåµço jîva-
loke jîva-bhüta˙ sanåtana˙ . However, the living beings who 
are conditioned by material nature and who have no con -
trol of their senses or knowledge of the Supreme Abode, 
are again and again reborn within the world of birth and 
death. At the time of death they are carried away to their 
next body by material desires and the mind, just as a fra -
grance is carried by the wind."

Anuv®tti
The åtmå is not perceivable by the material senses, nor 
can it be perceived by the aid of a microscope or any such 
scientific technology because it is transcendental, being 
composed of sac-cid-ånanda .
However, the presence of the åtmå can be understood 
by one’s intelligence when one hears from K®ß√a in Bhaga -
Bhagavad-gitavad-gîtå . Those with misguided intelligence and who are 
without knowledge cannot understand the åtmå by any 
endeavour, either when it is residing in the body or when 
it is leaving the body at the time of death. Only those with 
actual knowledge, who use their intelligence properly, can 
understand the åtmå."

Anuv®tti
By nature the material world is a dark and lifeless place. 
Without luminaries like the sun, moon and stars, the world 
would be dark indeed. Çrî K®ß√a says that the light of these 
celestial bodies emanates from Him and that He is also the 
potency that digests food and nourishes all life.
tat padaµ paramaµ brahma sarvaµ vibhajate jagat
mamaiva tad-dhanaµ tejo jñåtum arhasi bhårata
O Bhårata, The Supreme Brahman illuminates the 
entire universe. You should know that this great 
effulgence belongs to Me. ( Hari-vaµça  2.114.11)
To think that matter alone is the source of life is cer -
tainly a less intelligent proposal. The only example we 
Bhagavad-gitahave is that which we see all around us – that life comes 
from life. We also see that life is intelligently designed. 
Therefore, the rational conclusion should be that all life 
arises from an intelligent life source. Everything comes 
from K®ß√a.
oµ janmådy asya yata˙
The Supreme is He from whom the creation, sus -
tenance and annihilation of the manifested universe 
arises. ( Vedånta-sütra  1.1.2)
K®ß√a also says that He is situated in the hearts of all 
living beings as the Paramåtmå and from Him all remem -
brance, knowledge and forgetfulness arises. He says it is He 
alone who is to be known through the Vedas . He reveals 
the Vedånta,  the end of knowledge, and it is He who is the 
knower of the Vedas . This is also confirmed in the Hari-
vaµça  as follows:
vede råmåya√e caiva purå√e bhårate tathå
ådåv-cånte ca madhye ca hari˙ sarvatra gîyate
In the beginning, the middle and the end, all the 
Vedas , the Råmåya√a , the Purå√as  and the Mahåb -
hårata  only glorify K®ß√a. ( Hari-vaµça  3.132.35)
The Vedas  are divided into four main divisions – ‰g, 
Yajur, Såma  and Atharva Vedas . Then comes the Upanißads  
and supplementary literature such as the eighteen Purå√as  
(including the Çrîmad Bhågavatam ), Mahåbhårata  (Bhaga -
vad-gîtå ), Råmåya√a  and Vedånta-sütra . In all these it is 
Hari (Çrî K®ß√a) who is to be known.

Anuv®tti
The fallible beings in this world are those under the 
three modes of material nature and the infallible beings are 
those engaged in the pursuit of transcendental knowledge 
through the cultivation of K®ß√a consciousness. The infal -
lible living beings are known as liberated. Çrî K®ß√a says 
that He is superior to the fallible living beings and He is 
also transcendental to those who are infallible because He 
is the Supreme Person.
This means that at no time do the liberated living beings 
become the Supreme or one with K®ß√a. He is, and always 
Chapter 15371
will be, the Supreme Person. This is the declaration found 
in Bhagavad-gîtå and throughout the Vedic literature.
ekale îçvara k®ß√a åra saba bh®tya
yåre yaiche nåcåya se taiche kare n®tya
K®ß√a alone is the Supreme Controller. All others 
are His servants. They dance as He makes them do 
so. (Caitanya-caritåm®ta, Ådi-lîlå 5.142)
satyaµ satyaµ puna˙ satyam uddh®tya bhujam-ucyate

Raising my arms in the air, I loudly declare that 
there is no text greater than the Vedas , and no Deity 
superior to Keçava (K®ß√a). Again and again I say 
this is true, this is true, this is true. ( Hari-vaµça, 
Çeßa-dharma-parva  2.15)
Perfection of life in the material world means the culti -
vation of social structure, ( dharma ), economic development 
(artha ), material enjoyment ( kåma ) and salvation ( mokßa ). 
History shows us that seldom ever does a civilisation pro -
gress beyond social structure, economic development and 
material enjoyment. Salvation is the fourth goal of life and 
is rarely sought by those absorbed in material consciousness. 
Such hedonistic societies are easily satisfied by the fulfilment 
of eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Even more rare 
than salvation however is the fifth goal of life, prema-bhakti , 
or bhakti-yoga , the yoga of love.

The Supreme Person, Çrî K®ß√a and His transcen -
dental realm of V®ndåvana are the most worship -
pable objects. The supreme method of worshipping 
Him is that adopted by the beautiful gopîs, the young 
wives of Vraja. Çrîmad Bhågavatam  is the most pure 
and most authoritative çåstra , and divine love is the 
fifth and highest achievement of human life beyond 
dharma, artha, kåma  and mokßa . It is thus known as 
pañcama-purußårtha.  This is the verdict of Çrî Cait -
anya Mahåprabhu and we have the highest regard 
for this conclusion. ( Caitanya-mata-mañjußa )
Thus, the student of Bhagavad-gîtå has little interest 
in the first four goals of human society because all such 
achievements are temporary and do not lead to union 
(yoga) with the Supreme Person. Only that which leads 
one to Çrî K®ß√a should be the goal of one’s life.

In this chapter Çrî K®ß√a describes to Arjuna the two 
general categories of human beings, devas  and asuras , or 
the pious and impious. Up to this point, throughout the 
Gîtå, K®ß√a has mentioned many of the qualities and char -
Chapter 16379
acteristics of a deva. These are the qualities of what we 
would call a ‘good human being’ and these qualities are 
also conducive for self-realisation. These are described in 
verses 1 to 3 of this chapter.
Now K®ß√a begins to detail the qualities of the asura  
so that Arjuna can decide upon the path that he must take 
in life and the association he must choose. Ultimately, 
being able to discern between pious and impious natures, 
Arjuna will be able to perform the duties that lie ahead of 
him at Kurukßetra."

deluded by ignorance.
Bhagavad-gitaAnuv®tti
The inability to discriminate between proper and 
improper actions is the first recognisable characteristic of 
an asura . Additionally, Çrî K®ß√a says, they do not know 
what is purity, proper behaviour or truthfulness. Truth -
fulness, cleanliness, austerity and mercy are most desirable 
qualities for a human being, but these are totally lacking in 
one who has acquired the nature of an asura .
Çrî K®ß√a continues to describe in detail the qualities 
and characteristics of the asura  mentality and if one takes 
careful note of what K®ß√a is saying, then one is faced with 
the stark realisation that the world we live in today is dom -
inated by the thinking and activities of the asuras .
The structure of our world is now based on rampant 
consumerism, the ‘shop till you drop’ mentality. Enjoy, 
enjoy, enjoy! The ‘if it feels good, do it’ mentality is every -
where. We are led to believe that there is no ultimate reality, 
that this one life is the all in all, and therefore we should 
enjoy it while it lasts – the fulfilment of the sexual lust of 
men and women being at the forefront of such enjoyment. 
The epitome of this is represented worldwide by the casual 
and legal acceptance of contraception and abortion.
With the present mentality of the human being, it seems 
that the world is set on a path of destruction – with dev -
astation of the environment, economic collapse, extinction 
of species and even genocide of certain races of humans. 
Have we no eyes to see what is happening? Has the human 
race become so proud and arrogant of it’s achievements 
that it has become blind?
Good government is essential in a civilised world. Such 
a government is for the purpose of safeguarding society 
Chapter 16383
from danger – not just from the danger of an invading 
army, but also from the threat of unwholesome ideolo -
gies that may destroy a civilisation from within. Unfor -
tunately, it seems as though governments worldwide have 
abandoned all sense of proper behaviour and they them -
selves have become the leading plunderers of the people. 
Amassing wealth by any means and depriving the people 
from even the most basic necessities of life, such despots 
know no shame. Indeed, the world is in a period of great 
darkness at the hands of the asura  mentality.
From their high pulpits the heads of state declare, “Our 
enemies must be killed. The evildoers must be defeated. 
We shall be victorious, we shall rule the world, we shall 
enjoy, we are the chosen people, we are powerful, we are 
happy and none are our equals!” And while the hysteria of 
the masses runs wild, the innocent are sent to their graves 
and the Earth weeps for her children. Yet it seems we are 
unfazed. Such, K®ß√a says, is our ignorance."

Ultimately, there is no happiness, no success, no 
well-being nor advancement in self-realisation when one 
follows the path of the asura . What then should be done?
Çrî K®ß√a identifies the three main characteristics of 
the asura  mentality in verse 21 as kåma, krodha and lobha  
– lust, anger and greed. These are indeed the cause of 
great misfortune amongst all living beings and such are 
the destroyers of self-realisation. Therefore, lust, anger and 
greed must be conquered by one who wants to make pro -
gress in human life. To triumph over the great enemies of 
Chapter 16387
lust, anger and greed, one must apply oneself diligently to 
controlling the senses and perform the prescribed activities 
in bhakti-yoga  known as sådhana . The practice of sådhana  
is learned from the guru, a tattva-darçî  who has seen the 
truth, and the guru instructs the student according to their 
ability and present stage of advancement. To this end, 
the guru will advise all students in bhakti-yoga  to chant 
the mahå-mantra  and fix the mind upon Çrî K®ß√a. This 
process is purifying and beneficial to everyone, regardless 
of one’s being a novice or being very advanced. Everyone 
should engage in chanting the mahå-mantra  to defeat the 
enemies of lust, anger and greed, and to dispel the igno -
rance and darkness of the age of Kali-yuga.

Chapter 17393
Anuv®tti
In this chapter Çrî K®ß√a answers the question of Arjuna 
regarding those who reject the Vedas , but perform worship 
with some faith. Arjuna wants to know to which mode of 
material nature they belong. The first lesson to learn here 
is that by not following the Vedic injunctions one auto -
matically acts as one likes, but is henceforth always under 
the modes of material nature – goodness, passion and 
ignorance. Thus, one is never situated in transcendence. 
Çrî K®ß√a then further describes food, sacrifice, austerity 
and charity as they are influenced by, or born of, the three 
modes of material nature.
First faith ( çraddhå ) is discussed. Çrî K®ß√a tells Arjuna 
that çraddhå  arises in this life due to one’s own nature and 
from impressions in the mind from previous lives. All 
activities in life depend on faith to one degree or another. 
It does not matter what one’s creed may be – theist or 
atheist, one must have faith. The theist has faith that there 
is a God, and the atheist has faith that there is no God. If 
one states a particular doctrine or philosophy, but says he 
has no ‘faith’ then that is pure hypocrisy.
K®ß√a says that when one’s faith is in the mode of 
goodness, one worships the demigods such as Ga√eça, 
Çiva, Sürya, Indra and Sarasvatî etc. When one’s faith is in 
the mode of passion, one worships the spirits in nature or 
the ancestors – this also includes humanists and atheists. 
When one’s faith is in the mode of ignorance, one is found 
to worship ghosts and spirits. All these types of worship 
are current in the world today. 
In India, many people worship the demigods by building 
big temples and offering fire sacrifices known as yajñas . In 
Bhagavad-gitathe Far East, ancestor worship is very popular amongst the 
Buddhists, Shintoists and Taoists. Similarly, in Europe and 
America, great monuments are erected to revere scientists, 
politicians, soldiers, movie stars, rock stars etc. In Africa, 
Tibet, Mexico and South America, the worship of ghosts 
and spirits is popular. All these forms of worship are con -
ducted in the three modes of material nature. Therefore, 
having rejected the Vedas , it is to be concluded that the 
worshippers of demigods, ancestors, famous personalities, 
ghosts and spirits are not transcendentally situated.
To be transcendental to material nature means to 
accept the Vedas  and thus be situated beyond the modes 
of nature in the realm of viçuddha-sattva , pure goodness. 
When one’s faith is situated in pure goodness, one wor -
ships the Supreme Person, K®ß√a. This is the highest stage 
of monotheism – the acceptance of one Supreme Being. 
Pure-goodness is described by Çiva as follows:
sattvaµ viçuddhaµ vasudeva-çabditaµ
yad îyate tatra pumån apåv®ta˙
sattve ca tasmin bhagavån våsudevo
hy adhokßajo me namaså vidhîyate
One should always worship K®ß√a in pure goodness. 
Pure goodness is always pure consciousness in which 
the Absolute Truth, known as Våsudeva, is revealed 
without any covering. ( Çrîmad Bhågavatam  4.3.23)
In the stage of pure consciousness, one is guided by 
the highest type of faith called nirgu√a-çraddhå , transcen -
dental faith that is uncontaminated by the modes of mate -
rial nature. After many lifetimes of following the Vedas  
Chapter 17395
and associating with the virtuous and pious, one develops 
suk®ti , accumulated merit. This suk®ti  then leads one to the 
association of sådhus  (self-realised yogîs) and under their 
guidance nirgu√a-çraddhå  develops and progresses through 
various stages – ultimately reaching the highest stage of 
self-realisation, prema-bhakti.
Nirgu√a-çraddhå  awakens in the heart of the bhakti-yogî 
and enables one to see, hear and feel the subjective world, 
the Absolute Truth. Nirgu√a-çraddhå  is that which reveals 
K®ß√a just as a flash of lightning reveals the shape of a 
monsoon rain cloud in the dead of night. In the darkness 
of night, the cloud cannot be seen, but when lightning 
appears, the form of the cloud becomes visible. Similarly, 
when nirgu√a-çraddhå  appears in the heart of the yogî, one 
can perceive the ultimate form of beauty that is Çrî K®ß√a.
Guided by nirgu√a-çraddhå , the student of bhakti-yoga 
will feel that one is meant for K®ß√a – that he is not an 
independent being. One must feel completely dependent on 
K®ß√a. Such is the process of understanding the Supreme 
Person, who is beyond the modes of material nature.
K®ß√a says that one who is driven by lust, ambition, 
power, pride and egotism often undergoes severe austerities 
that are not prescribed in the Vedas  or in the process of 
bhakti-yoga  – such austerities parch the senses of the body. 
These may include austerities such as prolonged periods 
of fasting, self-flagellation, self-crucifixion, wearing cilice 
chains, piercing the body, walking on hot coals and so on. 
Because these austerities are performed in the mode of 
ignorance they neglect the Paramåtmå within – thus lead -
ing to no good result. K®ß√a says the performers of such 
austerities are to be known as asuras.

Anuv®tti
As Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the French politician, 
lawyer and connoisseur wrote in 1826, “ Dis-moi ce que 
tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es  – Tell me what you eat 
and I will tell you what you are.” In other words, you are 
what you eat. But in ancient times this was better under -
stood than in today’s world. Çrî K®ß√a says that all food is 
divided into three groups and is dear to one according to 
the acquired mode of nature.
Food that increases life, gives energy, strength, health, 
happiness and satisfaction is in the mode of goodness. 
This includes fruits, vegetables, grains, sugar, salt, spices 
and milk products. These are basically known as vegetarian 
foods and are dear to those in the mode of goodness.
Food that is too bitter, too sour, too sweet, too salty, 
too spicy, too pungent and too dry, that creates excessive 
heat in the stomach, causes pain, creates gas and disease is 
to be known as food in the mode of passion. Such food 
may be vegetarian, but it is usually over-salted, and over-
spiced. Too much salt and spice creates mucus in the body 
and leads to such diseases as high blood pressure, heart 
failure, diabetes and cancer. Such food should be avoided.
Bhagavad-gitaK®ß√a says that food that is stale, tasteless, foul smell -
ing, rotten, left behind by others or unfit for sacrifice, is 
food in the mode of ignorance. Food left behind by others 
means the scraps left behind on someone’s plate, that in 
western countries, are usually fed to dogs and cats. Food 
not fit for sacrifice means that food contaminated by an 
animal, or that has come in contact with something filthy 
and impure.
Food in the mode of ignorance may include some veg -
etarian food that has become contaminated. Food in the 
mode of ignorance generally pertains to all varieties of 
non-vegetarian foodstuff such as meat, fish and eggs. These 
include beef, mutton, goat, pig, chicken, venison, turkey, 
duck, turtle, prawn, crab, frog, insect, snake, clam, oyster, 
shark, whale, caviar, horse and dog, just to name a few. 
Absurd as it may sound to the student of bhakti-yoga , all 
the food mentioned above is very popular in various parts 
of the world. Such food is to be avoided by all classes of 
yogîs, as well as by progressive human beings in general.
All types of yogîs prefer food in the mode of goodness, 
but the bhakti-yogîs  prefer to eat only the remnants of food 
in the mode of goodness that has first been offered to Çrî 
K®ß√a with love and devotion ( yo me bhaktyå prayacchati ). 
Such remnants are called prasådam  or mahå-prasådam.
Even eating food in the mode of goodness carries a 
karmic  reaction if it is not first offered to K®ß√a. This 
has also been mentioned in Bhagavad-gîtå , Chapter Three, 
verse 13 as follows:
yajña-çiß†åçina˙ santo mucyante sarva-kilbißai˙
bhuñjate te tvaghaµ påpå ye pacanty-åtma-kåra√åt
Chapter 17399
Saintly persons are liberated from all types of impi -
ety by accepting the remnants of foodstuffs offered 
in sacrifice (to K®ß√a). However, those who only 
cook for themselves perpetuate their own bondage. 
Food that is to be offered to K®ß√a must be prepared 
with love and devotion, and in a kitchen that is clean and 
where domestic pets such as cats and dogs do not enter. 
Everyone loves their pets – indeed, Çrî K®ß√a Himself 
loves His two pet dogs, Vyåghra and Bhramaraka, as well 
as other animals. However, pets should not be allowed in 
the kitchen where offerings are prepared.
The student of bhakti-yoga  should not be a fanatic, but 
should practice moderation in all things. However, the 
yogî should be diligent to avoid food in the modes of pas -
sion and ignorance."

sacrifice is faithless and in the mode of ignorance. 
Anuv®tti
For every age the Vedic literature recommends a par -
ticular sacrifice for those desiring self-realisation. It should 
be noted that those sacrifices are never in the category of 
blood sacrifice. In other words, those seeking self-realisa -
tion never perform animal or human sacrifice. Both animal 
and human sacrifice have been practiced in many parts of 
the world since ancient times, but at no time in history 
have there been animal or human sacrifices performed by 
those seeking self-realisation in bhakti-yoga.
In today’s world, some religious sects sacrifice animals 
before eating them. Similar rituals are performed in other 
sects wherein a symbolic representation of the blood and 
body of a saint are eaten. However, one should know that 
all such barbaric activities are completely absent in the 
practice of bhakti-yoga.
Chapter 17401
In the modern age, the Vedic literature gives recom -
mendation for only one sacrifice and that is k®ß√a-sa∫kîr -
tana in which one chants the mahå-mantra , preceded by 
the pañca-tattva mantra:
jaya çrî k®ß√a caitanya, prabhu nityånanda
jaya advaita gadådhara çrîvåsådi gaura-bhakta-v®nda
hare k®ß√a hare k®ß√a k®ß√a k®ß√a hare hare
hare råma hare råma råma råma hare hare
The chanting of the pañca-tattva mantra  is to precede 
the mahå-mantra  and frees the chanter from any previous 
offences that may have been committed knowingly or 
unknowingly. When the performance of k®ß√a-sa∫kîrtana  
is done alongside the distribution of K®ß√a mahå-prasådam  
it is considered perfect and complete. In the age of Kali-
yuga no other sacrifice is necessary."

Austerities performed out of foolishness that inflict pain on 
oneself and others, are said to be in the mode of ignorance.
Anuv®tti
Austerity is called tapasya , or the undertaking of some 
measure of practice that diminishes material activities and 
promotes a conscious awareness of the Absolute Truth. 
These austerities are described in verses 14, 15 and 16. 
Physical austerities are described as maintaining purity 
(cleanliness), sincerity, celibacy and non-violence. Celibacy 
means not to engage in acts of illicit sex (sex outside of 
marriage). Physical austerity also includes the worship of 
the Supreme Person and honouring the guru and saintly 
persons.
Austerities that are performed out of pride and for the 
purpose of prestige, name and fame are to be rejected. This 
may also include fasting for political, social or economic 
advantages. Austerities performed out of foolishness that 
cause pain and suffering should also be rejected. All such 
austerities are thus abandoned because they are performed 
Bhagavad-gitain the modes of passion and ignorance – the results of 
which are temporary and do not promote self-realisation.
Speaking truthfully, but not in such a way as to offend 
others, is known as verbal austerity. The saying is, ‘the 
truth hurts’, but this does not apply to Bhagavad-gîtå . The 
truth should be presented in such a way that it is attractive 
and pleasing to hear.
satyaµ brüyåt priyaµ brüyånna brüyåt satyam-apriyaµ
priyaµ ca nån®taµ brüyåd eßa dharma˙ sanåtana˙
One should only speak the truth, and one’s speech 
should be pleasing. One should not speak any truth 
that offends and one should not speak any lie even 
if it is pleasing – such is eternal dharma . (Manu-
saµhitå  4.138)
Çrî K®ß√a is the friend and well-wisher of all living 
beings and His message should be presented in that way. 
Bhagavad-gîtå  does not condemn – it simply points to that 
which should be done and that which should not be done."

Charity that is given with disdain, at the wrong time and

of ignorance.
Anuv®tti
Now the ideal of charity is being discussed – what types 
of charity should be performed, to whom and for what pur -
pose. It is certainly the duty of every person to look out for 
his fellow human being. As such, no one should go hungry 
in this world, be without clothing, proper shelter, educa -
tion or sufficient medical care. That is the ideal for human 
society. But our present reality is quite different – there 
are shortages of food, inadequate clothing, shelter, educa -
tion and medical treatment in many places in the world, 
causing millions of human beings to suffer unnecessarily. 
This suffering, however, is not due to a lack of commodi -
Bhagavad-gitaties as much as it is due to mismanagement and hoarding. 
There are sufficient facilities to maintain everyone on this 
Earth in a proper state of health and well-being, but the 
facilities are simply mismanaged. And more to blame than 
the mismanagement between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ 
of this world, is hoarding. There is enough wealth in the 
world to easily solve the problems facing humanity, par -
ticularly that of hunger – but that wealth is being hoarded 
by a very small minority of people. They have amassed 
so much that no individual could spend or use that much 
wealth within one or even a dozen lifetimes. Corporate 
giants receive millions of dollars in annual bonuses while 
millions of children die each year due to malnutrition. Is 
this not shameful?
Charity, like other things discussed in this chapter, is 
also in the different modes of nature according to how it is 
given and whom it is given to. There is charity in goodness, 
passion and ignorance as stated by Çrî K®ß√a above, but 
ultimately the highest charity is to give that which helps 
the human being bring an end to all material miseries and 
even to death itself. Such charity is the distribution of the 
spiritual wealth found in Bhagavad-gîtå.
The root cause of all suffering in the world is a lack of 
understanding of who we are, where we have come from, 
what the purpose of life is and where we will go at the 
time of death. One who understands these things from the 
perspective of Bhagavad-gîtå  becomes full in knowledge, 
free from the illusion of the body as the self and ultimately 
defeats death. This is the highest gift and greatest charity 
that one can give a fellow human being.

Anuv®tti
One who acts whimsically never achieves happiness 
or perfection in this life or the next. One should there -
fore perform all austerities, sacrifice and acts of charity in 
the mode of goodness as prescribed in Bhagavad-gîtå , for 
passion and ignorance simply drag one down to the lower 
stages of consciousness.
Herein, it is stated that in ancient times all acts and 
injunctions of the Vedas  were accompanied with the words, 
oµ tat sat , indicating the Absolute Truth, the Supreme 
Person, Çrî K®ß√a. This practice however is no longer in 
vogue in Kali-yuga. To the contrary, the real purpose of 
human life is all but forgotten and people regrettably live 
their lives aimlessly, eating, drinking and merrymaking.
K®ß√a has already said in Bhagavad-gîtå  that what a 
great man does, the common men will follow ( yad yad 
åcarati çreß†has tat tad evetaro jana˙ ). Therefore, we call 
upon all good-hearted men and women of the world 
to hasten to the message of Bhagavad-gîtå  and accept 
Çrî K®ß√a as the Supreme Person. Such a movement 
in the world, under the banner of Bhagavad-gîtå , will 
surely bring about the greatest fortune and well-being 
of humanity. No greater good can be done than this and 
there is no greater time for this than the present.

realise that sannyåsa  means the renunciation of activities 
performed for personal benefit. Tyåga  refers to the renun -

Anuv®tti
The final chapter of Bhagavad-gîtå  begins with an 
inquiry about sannyåsa  and tyåga . Çrî K®ß√a says that san-
nyåsa  means to renounce activities performed for one’s 
own personal benefit, and tyåga  means the renunciation 
of all activities. One at the stage of sannyåsa  is called a 
Bhagavad-gitasannyåsî . To be a sannyåsî  means to act for the benefit 
of the complete whole, the Absolute Good, Çrî K®ß√a. A 
sannyåsî  performs all types of actions, but does so only in 
bhakti-yoga , in the service of K®ß√a.
The social structure of the bhakti-yoga  community is 
divided into four spiritual orders – brahmacårî, g®hastha, 
vånaprastha  and sannyåsa . All these are to study the Vedic 
literature. Additionally, their duties are as follows: the 
brahmacårîs  are the students, whose duties are service to the 
spiritual master and the observance of celibacy. G®hasthas  
are the householders, whose duties are to earn an honest 
living, to give in charity and to raise children. Vånaprasthas  
are those who have completed household affairs and whose 
duties are to relinquish their wealth, visit holy places and 
cultivate detachment. The sannyåsîs  are the spiritual mas -
ters in the bhakti-yoga  community and they are to give 
lessons to the brahmacårîs , g®hasthas  and vånaprasthas , to 
be renounced from worldly pleasure, to be detached from 
politics and to always be engaged in bhakti-yoga  with kaya, 
mana, våkya,  jîva – by body, mind, words and the full sur -
render of the self. Sannyåsa  and tyåga  are further described

according to one’s nature and that beneficial works such as 
sacrifice, charity and austerity should never be abandoned 
for they are purifying even for the wise."

It is impossible for those who have accepted a mate -

who renounces the results of his actions is known as a 
true renunciate.
Bhagavad-gitaAnuv®tti
If one gives up activities out of bewilderment, consid -
ering them to be troublesome, physically taxing or gives 
up activities out of laziness, then such renunciation is con -
sidered false and in the modes of passion and ignorance. 
Those who are embodied can never give up action. In 
ancient times as well as in our own, there are many exam -
ples of those who have abandoned everything, ran to the 
Himålayas or to the deserts to escape the world, but again 
returned to resume a life of sense enjoyment or to perform 
philanthropic activities.
When one gives up attachment to the results of one’s 
actions and acts with a detached heart – remembering 
always that Çrî K®ß√a is the only enjoyer and proprietor of 
everything – then such a person is a true tyågî or sanny -
åsî. Thus, the renunciation of a tyågî and a sannyåsî  are the 
same."

Those who have no false ego and whose minds are detached

do not kill and are not bound by their actions.
Anuv®tti
Arjuna is a kßatriya , a warrior, and he stands with Çrî 
K®ß√a on the battlefield of Kurukßetra between two great 
armies. Seeing friends and well-wishers on both sides, 
Arjuna initially resolved not to fight, but to throw down 
his weapons and renounce his duty. Çrî K®ß√a herein brings 
our attention back to the battlefield when He says, hatvå’pi 
sa imål-lokån na hanti na nibadhyate – he who kills does 
not actually kill and does not incur any reaction.
If Arjuna abandons his duty as a warrior, then certainly 
he will incur a karmic  reaction for avoiding his duty. How -
ever, Arjuna will not actually ‘kill’ anyone in the truest 
sense of the word, because the living beings arrayed before 
him ready for battle are eternal parts and parcels of the 
Supreme Person and thus eternal. The åtmå can never be 
‘killed’. And lastly, Arjuna will not incur any karmic  reac-
tion for doing his duty.
If one avoids one’s prescribed duties and renounces 
them out of fear, bewilderment and so forth, then one 
Chapter 18421
incurs a karmic  reaction and has to suffer in this life or the 
next. Therefore, K®ß√a wants Arjuna to give up his weak -
ness of heart and perform his duty."

Knowledge, as previously explained, means to under -
stand the difference between matter and consciousness. 
Those whose knowledge is pure and uncontaminated see 
individual consciousness as parts and parcels of the undi -
vided Super Consciousness, as present in all species and as 
transmigrating from one body to the next, life after life. In 
other words, the same åtmå may be present in one life in 
Chapter 18423
the body of an elephant or a tiger, and in the next life in 
the body of a human being. There are no elephant, tiger or 
animal åtmås  as distinguished from human åtmås . One who 
says that the åtmå of an animal and that of a human or a 
demigod are different åtmås  has knowledge influenced by 
the mode of passion.
One who has no proper understanding of the åtmå, 
who is attached to the body, the actions of the body, who 
is absorbed in the trivial pursuits of economic develop -
ment and sense enjoyment, is said to have knowledge in 
the mode of ignorance."

Herein, actions in goodness, passion and ignorance are 
described. When one looks at the world today, bearing 
in mind the different modes of action and their charac -
teristics, then it is no wonder that the planet is in such a 
state of conflict, inflation, depression, economic despair, 
confusion and denial.
When people are busy exercising their over-inflated 
egos, acting unscrupulously and violently toward their 
fellow human beings and animals, how are we to expect 
any improvement in the world? How can there be peace?
Therefore, it is the duty of every sane human being to 
cultivate knowledge and actions in the mode of goodness 
that are without attachment or aversion and are free from 
desire and egotism. Life is a science, and Çrî K®ß√a says 
that through our actions we reap the harvest of our good 
or bad karma .

Anuv®tti
Throughout the Bhagavad-gîtå , Çrî K®ß√a addresses 
Arjuna as Pårtha, the son of Kuntî. K®ß√a also addresses 
him as Bhårata (best of the Bharata Dynasty), På√∂ava 
(son of På√∂u), Kuru-nandana (descendant of the Kurus), 
Parantapa (conqueror of the enemy), Gu∂åkeça (con -
queror of sleep) and Dhanañjaya, (winner of wealth). 
K®ß√a addresses Arjuna thusly to remind him of his posi -
tion as a great warrior in a dynasty of warriors and to 
encourage him to stand and fight.
Sometimes fighting is necessary if it is for the right 
cause, but the problem lies herein. Who is to say which 
cause is just, who is right and who is wrong, what should 
be done and what should not be done? In the above verses, 
K®ß√a gives some indication as to who is of the right men -
tality and right determination. Clearly, those in the modes 
of passion and ignorance are always mistaken – not being 
able to distinguish right from wrong, what is to be done 
from what is not to be done, or proper duty from derelic -
tion of duty.

material nature.
Anuv®tti
Everyone and everything in the material world is gov -
erned by the three modes of material nature. In the truest 
sense of the word, there is no meaning of freedom or inde -
pendence unless one is free from the modes of nature. All 
such celebrations in the name of political emancipation 
are merely another form of self-deception. Where is the 
question of freedom when our every action is controlled by 
nature and we are being pushed down the highway of life 
to face ultimate death? 
Independence from the three modes of material nature 
is only afforded to those who have taken shelter of a bona-
fide guru, who have understood the knowledge of Bhaga -
vad-gîtå  and have applied themselves to bhakti-yoga . Only 
the bhakti-yogî  can truly celebrate freedom.
Çrî K®ß√a says that happiness in the mode of good -
ness is bitter in the beginning, but nectar in the end. This 
Chapter 18431
means that to control the senses and perform austerities 
(tapasya ) in the beginning may be distasteful for the 
novice, but in the end such austerities lead to the nectar 
of self-realisation.
Happiness derived from enjoying one’s senses in the 
mode of passion may be like nectar in the beginning, but 
it is bitter in the end because sense gratification ultimately 
ends in frustration, hatred and anger. Happiness that arises 
from sleep, laziness and delusion and is self-deceptive is 
in the mode of ignorance because it is miserable in the 
beginning and miserable in the end.
Real happiness only comes when one awakens to the 
eternal self and lives a life with one’s body, mind and 
senses absorbed in a higher conscious plane."

Herein, the status of the bråhma√as, kßatriyas, vaiçyas  
and çüdras  are described according to the qualities of their 
work. These are the four social orders of life and they are 
present in all civilised cultures in the world. Everywhere 
we find those that resemble the bråhma√as , the intellectual 
class. Everywhere there are those that resemble kßatriyas,  
administrators and warriors, and everywhere we find the 
mercantile and labour class, the vaiçyas  and çüdras . These 
Chapter 18433
are the natural divisions in society and they are determined 
by the quality of their work.
Unfortunately, in modern India, this social system 
described by Çrî K®ß√a in the Bhagavad-gîtå  has become 
corrupted and is now known as the caste system which 
determines one’s social status by birth. The caste system 
is not actually the social system described in Bhagavad-gîtå  
known as var√åçrama-dharma .
The caste system in India is certainly deplorable, hardly 
better than that of slavery, because it limits a person’s 
potential according to one’s birth. K®ß√a clearly states that 
a person is to be known by his actions and not his pedigree.
Although social systems having intellectuals, adminis -
trators, mercantile and labour classes are found around the 
world, they are also not the same as the var√åçrama system 
mentioned in Bhagavad-gîtå.
In addition to being an intellectual, a bråhma√a must 
know what is Brahman. A kßatriya  must do more than just 
administrate and fight battles – he must be above corrup -
tion, give protection to the people and protect the prin -
ciples of dharma  found in Bhagavad-gîtå . And above all, a 
kßatriya  is never to be an aggressor – he is never to invade 
a sovereign country.
The duty of a vaiçya,  in addition to business, is farm -
ing and cow protection. Naturally, the purpose of busi -
ness is to earn a living, but nowadays this has gone far 
beyond actual necessity as per the advice of Bhagavad-gîtå.  
Simple business has turned into massive industry – the 
establishing of mega multi-national corporations, money 
hoarding and fractional banking. These in turn have led to 
the corruption of government officials around the world 
Bhagavad-gitaand ultimately to the destruction of the environment, 
increased poverty, and war.
Cow protection ( k®ßi-gorakßya ) is especially mentioned 
in verse 44 because of all animals it is the cow that is most 
necessary for the survival of the human being. Human 
bodies thrive on animal fat and the cow is the animal that 
provides human beings with the most milk, yogurt, butter, 
cheese etc. Milk and milk products, when taken in appro -
priate quantities, provide the human being all the necessary 
fat required for healthy living, thus enabling the suspen -
sion of animal slaughter. In other words, killing animals 
and eating meat is not necessary to obtain fat. When cows 
are protected then there will be plenty of whole milk avail -
able for everyone to maintain a healthy diet. The value of 
the cow for human society is indisputable and therefore 
in Vedic culture the cow is considered one of the seven 
natural mothers. These seven mothers are as follows:
åtma-måtå guro˙ patnî bråhma√î råja-patnikå
dhenur dhåtrî tathå p®thvî saptaitå måtara˙ sm®tå˙
One’s own mother, the wife of the guru, the wife of 
a bråhma√a , the king’s wife, the cow, the nurse and 
the Earth – these should be considered as our seven 
mothers. ( Cå√akya Nîti-çåstra  5.23)
Unfortunately, the business community has turned to 
corporate farming and mass slaughter of cows and other 
animals in the name of delivering health and prosperity to 
the people. In actuality, the people have lost their lands 
and the family farm that was once the backbone of socie -
ties everywhere has ceased to exist. Industrial farming has 
Chapter 18435
replaced organic fertilisers with chemical fertilisers that 
render the soil lifeless and produce food that is low in 
nutrition and high in toxic content. The meat from the 
slaughterhouse is also toxic and far less healthy than a 
vegetarian diet.
Society cries for the return of the vaiçya  worldwide, but 
governments turn a deaf ear and a blind eye and it is the 
çüdra , the labourer class, at the tail end of the food chain 
who suffers the most. But change is in the air as people 
worldwide wake up from the nightmare that has become 
their reality and seek genuine answers to their problems. 
For such sincere persons, Bhagavad-gîtå  will provide much 
insight and guidance."

Anuv®tti
In the above verses, Çrî K®ß√a stresses to Arjuna 
that one’s duties or prescribed dharma  according to the 
var√åçrama  system should never be abandoned. One may 
think that they are not performing their duty perfectly, but 
K®ß√a says that one should remain steadfast and not yield 
to abandonment.
At the beginning of Bhagavad-gîtå , Arjuna showed 
an inclination to abandon his duty as a kßatriya . Arjuna 
was disinclined to fight and was thinking that it might be 
better to take up the plough or the staff of renunciation, 
but K®ß√a did not agree.
Now the dialogue between Çrî K®ß√a and Arjuna is 
drawing to a close and we will soon see that K®ß√a has 
revived Arjuna and with a regained heart, he will resume 
his duty with full enthusiasm."

Çrî K®ß√a now gives Arjuna an infusion of encourage -

will realise the Absolute Truth and will enter His Supreme 
Abode. By consciously offering the results of all his actions 
unto K®ß√a, by devoting himself to K®ß√a and always think -
ing about K®ß√a, Arjuna will achieve all perfection.
The alternative, K®ß√a says, is that by neglecting His 
instructions, Arjuna will surely perish. This is the open 
secret of Bhagavad-gîtå  – one who adheres to its message, 
that is free from all material defects and is delivered by 
the Supreme Person, Çrî K®ß√a, becomes perfect in knowl -
edge and self-realisation. Neglecting K®ß√a’s instructions is 
however tantamount to spiritual suicide and K®ß√a warns 
Arjuna that if he takes that path he will surely perish into 
the world of bewilderment, illusion and death.

In verse 63 Çrî K®ß√a says that He has disclosed to 
Arjuna the most confidential knowledge and tells Arjuna 
to deliberate upon it and then do as he wishes. But because 
Arjuna is very dear to K®ß√a and because K®ß√a is Arju -
na’s guru and well-wisher, K®ß√a again gives him one last 
instruction and assurance.
K®ß√a’s final instruction is that Arjuna should always 
fix his mind upon Him, he should devote himself fully to 
Him, worship Him and offer his respects unto Him. This 
is the essence of K®ß√a consciousness. K®ß√a says that by 
doing this Arjuna will surely come to Him. The ultimate 
instruction to always remember K®ß√a is also stated in 
Padma Purå√a  as follows:
smartavya˙ satataµ viß√ur vismartavyo na jåtucit
sarve vidhi-nißedhå˙ syur etayor eva ki∫karå˙
Çrî K®ß√a (Viß√u) should always be remembered and 
never be forgotten at anytime. All rules and regula -
tions mentioned in the çåstra  should be subservient 
to these two principles. ( Padma Purå√a 6.71.100)
Bhagavad-gitaIn verse sixty-six, we find the climax of Bhagavad-gîtå , 
wherein the ultimate dharma  of surrendering oneself fully 
to K®ß√a is stated. Çrî K®ß√a tells Arjuna that giving up 
everything to follow His instructions need not be a cause 
of fear because K®ß√a will protect him. By such self-sur -
render Arjuna will come to K®ß√a in His Supreme Abode. 
The Supreme Abode lies beyond the material universe 
and is known by those who are learned as Vaiku√†ha. 
Those who worship the Viß√u avatåras,  or forms of 
Nåråya√a, will attain to the Vaiku√†ha realm. But superior 
to Vaiku√†ha are the realms of K®ß√a’s avatåras  such as Çrî 
Råmacandra in Ayodhyå and Våsudeva K®ß√a in Dvårakå. 
Those who worship Çrî Råmacandra and K®ß√a’s expan -
sion as Våsudeva, will attain to Ayodhyå, Dvårakå and 
Mathurå respectively.
Superior to Dvårakå is Mathurå. Superior to Mathurå 
is V®ndåvana. Govardhana is superior to V®ndåvana and 
Rådhå-ku√∂a is superior to Govardhana. Only those who 
worship K®ß√a’s human-like form known as Çyåmasundara 
(Govinda) will attain to the topmost realm.

Because Çrî K®ß√a appeared there, Mathurå is consid -
ered to be spiritually superior to Vaiku√†ha. Greater 
than Mathurå is the forest of V®ndåvana because 
this was where the råsa-lîlå  pastimes of K®ß√a took 
place. Govardhana Hill is considered to be superior 
Chapter 18445
to V®ndåvana because K®ß√a performed wonder -
ful pastimes there and raised it with His left hand. 
However, Rådhå-ku√∂a is superior to Govardhana 
because it is brimming with the nectar of divine love 
for the Master of Gokula. Which intelligent person 
will not render service to this place that is situated at 
the feet of Govardhana? ( Upadeçåm®ta  9)
The Supreme Abode of K®ß√a is the land of Vraja, 
which includes V®ndåvana, Govardhana and Rådhå-ku√∂a. 
In verse 66, Çrî K®ß√a indicates to Arjuna by the use of 
the verb ‘ vraja ’ (meaning ‘to go’) that Arjuna will come 
to K®ß√a in the topmost realm of the spiritual world. This 
superior realm is also known as Goloka V®ndåvana and is 
described in Brahma-saµhitå  as follows:

Herein, Çrî K®ß√a says that those who are envious 
cannot be taught the science of the Absolute Truth. How -
ever, those with the fortitude of K®ß√a consciousness , who 
study this sacred conversation between K®ß√a and Arjuna 
and who teach this knowledge to the non-envious are dear 
to K®ß√a and will achieve perfection and attain K®ß√a’s 
abode. This is confirmed in the following verses of the

Chapter 18453
Anuv®tti
The sacred conversation between Çrî K®ß√a and Arjuna 
ends with verse seventy-three wherein Arjuna says that his 
delusion and doubts have all been dispelled. Thus Arjuna 
agrees to follow K®ß√a’s instructions. This is the ideal 
relationship between guru and disciple. The guru must 
dispel the delusion and doubts of a disciple by delivering 
the message of Çrî K®ß√a found in Bhagavad-gîtå , without 
change or adulteration, and the disciple must be willing to 
follow such instructions.
The potency of hearing K®ß√a’s message is also con -
firmed in Çrîmad Bhågavatam  as follows:
ç®√vatåµ sva-kathå˙ k®ß√a˙ pu√ya-çrava√a-kîrtana˙
h®dy-anta˙ stho hy-abhadrå√i vidhunoti suh®t satåm
Çrî K®ß√a is the friend of the pious. He removes all 
inauspiciousness from the heart of those who have 
developed the desire to hear His message, which is 
virtuous when properly heard and chanted. ( Çrîmad 
Bhågavatam  1.2.17)
Sañjaya has been narrating the conversation between 
Çrî K®ß√a and Arjuna to Emperor Dh®taråß†ra and now he 
expresses his own satisfaction and ecstasy. He says that 
by remembering the words of Çrî K®ß√a and by seeing His 
beautiful form, he feels great ecstasy ( h®ßya ) and great 
wonder ( vismaya ). Sañjaya then concludes with the bene -
diction that wherever there is Çrî K®ß√a, the Master of yoga, 
and wherever there is Arjuna, the sincere disciple, there will 
always be prosperity, victory, opulence and righteousness.
